# linkingUSD

linkingUSD is the root quote token used by USD stablecoins on Tempo's decentralized exchange. It enables stablecoin interoperability by serving as a neutral hub for all USD stablecoin trading.

## Overview

linkingUSD is a non-transferable, USD-denominated accounting unit that serves as the common quote token for all USD stablecoins on the exchange. It exists to:

- **Concentrate liquidity** - All USD stablecoins trade against linkingUSD, preventing liquidity fragmentation
- **Maintain neutrality** - No specific issuer's token is privileged as the base quote
- **Simplify routing** - Direct trading pairs between stablecoins without complex routing
- **Reduce slippage** - Concentrated liquidity improves price discovery and minimizes slippage

## Properties

- **Address**: `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- **Non-transferable**: Cannot be transferred between accounts or used as a standard stablecoin
- **Quote token only**: Used exclusively for exchange accounting and order books
- **Cannot pay fees**: Users cannot pay transaction fees with linkingUSD

## How It Works

When you create a USD stablecoin on Tempo, you typically set linkingUSD as its quote token:

```solidity
TIP20 token = factory.createToken(
  "My Company USD",
  "MCUSD",
  "USD",
  TIP20(0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000), // linkingUSD
  msg.sender
);
```

This means:
- Your token trades against linkingUSD on the exchange
- Users can swap between your token and other USD stablecoins that also use linkingUSD
- All liquidity is concentrated in linkingUSD pairs

## Hub-and-Spoke Structure

This creates a hub-and-spoke structure where all USD stablecoins trade against linkingUSD:

```
               USDC
                |
    USDP -- linkingUSD -- PYUSD
                |
               USDT
```

Any stablecoin can convert to any other through linkingUSD with just two hops, ensuring simple routing, concentrated liquidity, and efficient pricing—even for thinly-traded pairs.

### Example: Cross-Stablecoin Payment

1. Market makers provide liquidity for USDC/linkingUSD and USDP/linkingUSD pairs
2. User wants to send USDC to a merchant who prefers USDP
3. DEX atomically routes: User's USDC → linkingUSD → Merchant's USDP
4. Single transaction, no manual swaps

This is critical for payments between parties in different regulatory regimes with different stablecoin preferences. The user and merchant never touch linkingUSD, it exists only as routing infrastructure.

## Why Non-Transferable?

linkingUSD is designed as an accounting unit, not a circulating stablecoin. This design:

- Prevents it from being used outside the exchange
- Ensures it serves purely as a neutral reference point
- Avoids regulatory complexity of issuing a transferable USD stablecoin
- Prevents it from competing in the end-user stablecoin market

## Flexibility

While linkingUSD is the recommended and incentivized default, users can designate alternative quote tokens if they prefer. Tempo supports this flexibility, but encourages linkingUSD adoption through yield distribution from reserves to DEX participants.
