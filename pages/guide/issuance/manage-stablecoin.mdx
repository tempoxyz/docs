# Manage Your Stablecoin

Manage your stablecoin's permissions, supply, and compliance settings using role-based access control and administrative functions.

## Roles & Permissions

TIP-20 tokens use a role-based access control system that allows you to delegate different administrative functions to different addresses:

| Role | Purpose | Key Functions |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Admin** | Full control | Grant/revoke all roles, set supply caps, change policies |
| **Issuer** | Token supply | Mint and burn tokens |
| **Pause** | Emergency control | Pause token transfers |
| **Unpause** | Emergency control | Unpause token transfers |
| **Burn Blocked** | Compliance | Burn tokens from blocked addresses |

### Granting Roles

Grant roles to delegate specific token permissions:

```solidity
TIP20 token = TIP20(0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000004);

// Grant the issuer role to treasury, to mint tokens
address treasuryAddress = 0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef;
token.grantRole(keccak256("ISSUER_ROLE"), treasuryAddress);

// Grant the pause role to security, to pause transfers
address securityAddress = 0xcafecafebabedeadbeefcafebabedeadbeefcafebabe;
token.grantRole(keccak256("PAUSE_ROLE"), securityAddress);
```

## Supply Management

### Setting Supply Caps

Control the maximum total supply by setting a supply cap:

```solidity
// Set supply cap to 1 billion tokens (USD has 6 decimals)
token.setSupplyCap(1_000_000_000_000_000);

// Remove supply cap (unlimited)
token.setSupplyCap(type(uint256).max);
```

Setting supply caps requires the **`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`**. The new cap cannot be less than the current total supply.

### Pausing Transfers

Temporarily halt all token transfers for emergency situations or maintenance:

```solidity
// Pause all transfers
token.pause();

// Later, unpause to resume normal operation
token.unpause();
```

Pausing requires the **`PAUSE_ROLE`**. Unpausing requires the **`UNPAUSE_ROLE`**.

## Transfer Policies

Configure transfer policies to control who can send and receive your stablecoin. This is useful for compliance and regulatory requirements.

Transfer policies can be:
- **Always allow**: Anyone can send/receive (default)
- **Whitelist**: Only authorized addresses can send/receive
- **Blacklist**: Blocked addresses cannot send/receive

## Best Practices

1. **Separate roles**: Use different addresses for different roles (treasury for minting, security for pausing)
2. **Set supply caps**: Prevent unlimited inflation by setting appropriate supply caps
3. **Monitor events**: Watch for role changes, mints, burns, and administrative actions
4. **Emergency procedures**: Have pause/unpause roles ready for security incidents
