# Foundry for Tempo

Tempo builds on top of [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry): the leading Ethereum development toolkit, through a custom fork that adds first-class support for Tempo.

This fork extends Foundry with Tempo's [protocol-level features](/documentation/protocol/), enabling developers to build, test, and deploy contracts that go [beyond the limits of standard EVM chains](/guide/quickstart/evm-compatibility).

For general information about Foundry, see the [Foundry documentation](https://getfoundry.sh/).

## Get started with Foundry

### Install using `foundryup`

This will install the latest `nightly` release of the Tempo fork.

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup -n tempo
```

To install a specific version, replace `<TAG_NAME>` with the desired release tag:

```bash
foundryup -n tempo -i <TAG_NAME>
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
forge --version
# forge Version: 1.4.4-dev-tempo
# Commit SHA: 6f3197e9940ea01f39c0bc9962c4529edf4b9768
# Build Timestamp: 2025-11-10T23:17:40.582299000Z (1762816660)
# Build Profile: release
```

You should see version information include `-tempo`, indicating you are using the Tempo fork.

### Create a new Foundry project

Initialize a new project with Tempo support:

```bash
forge init -n tempo my-project && cd my-project
```

Each new project is configured for Tempo out of the box, with [`tempo-std`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-std), the Tempo standard library installed, containing helpers for Tempo's protocol-level features.

## Use Foundry for your workflows

All standard Foundry commands are supported out of the box.

### Test & deploy with `forge`

```bash
# Build your contracts
forge build
# Run tests
forge test
# Run tests with Tempo testnet fork
forge test --fork-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz
# Deploy a simple contract
forge create src/Mail.sol:Mail \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz \
  --interactive \
  --broadcast \
  --constructor-args 0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001
# Run a deployment script
forge script script/Mail.s.sol \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz \
  --interactive \
  --broadcast
```

### Interact & debug with `cast`

```bash
# Check that your contract is deployed:
cast code <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz
# Interact with your contract:
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "myFunction()(uint256)" \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz
# Send a transaction:
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "myFunction(uint256)" 42 \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz \
  --interactive
# Replay a transaction by hash:
cast run <TX_HASH> \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz
```
