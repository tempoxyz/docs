# Andante [The fourth Tempo testnet]

## What's New

Andante is our fourth Tempo testnet, released on October 21st, 2025.

### Stablecoin Exchange

Andante introduces an [enshrined stablecoin exchange](/documentation/exchange) (DEX) designed specifically for trading between stablecoins of the same underlying asset. Built directly into the protocol as a precompiled contract, the exchange provides optimal pricing for cross-stablecoin trading with built-in MEV protection and significantly lower gas costs compared to traditional DEXs.

The exchange also introduces [linkingUSD](/documentation/tokens/linkingUSD), a system-level TIP-20 token that serves as a common accounting unit across all stablecoin pools, enabling efficient multi-hop trading and unified liquidity provision.

Learn how to start [executing swaps](/documentation/exchange/executing-swaps) or [providing liquidity](/documentation/exchange/providing-liquidity) on the exchange.

### Native Account Abstraction

Andante fully integrates [native account abstraction](/protocol/transactions/account-abstraction) at the protocol level as a new kind of transaction type. This should eliminate the need for separate entry point contracts. This transaction type makes it easy to support use cases like [batch transactions](/documentation/transactions/batch-transactions), [fee sponsorship](/documentation/transactions/fee-sponsorship), [scheduling](/documentation/transactions/scheduled-transactions), and the ability to use [passkeys](/documentation/accounts/passkeys) as wallets on Tempo.

## Additional Updates

### Consensus Expansion

This testnet is experimenting with a third-party validator in consensus that is actively working on their deployment during the testnet period. As a result, the testnet may experience reduced performance due to less optimized validator nodes.

### TIP-20 Address Shift

All addresses for TIP-20 tokens have been shifted by one. The `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000` address is now reserved for [linkingUSD](/documentation/tokens/linkingUSD), a system-level TIP-20 built for the newly added enshrined [stablecoin exchange](/documentation/exchange).

### Granular Block Timestamps

Blocks now include a granular timestamp as part of the header via the `timestampMillisPart` field, providing millisecond-level precision for improved time accuracy.

### Replay Transactions

The `cast run` command allows you to replay and debug any transaction by its hash. This is particularly useful for understanding what happened in a transaction, viewing internal calls, and analyzing gas usage.

```bash
# Example: Check AlphaUSD balance
cast balance --erc20 0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001 0x820525B56cF3cD426e58507F65DCaCB90BceEFb8 \
# Replay a transaction and see its execution trace
cast run 0x5c7469a9d436516f0c748abdef96fb3628f901cb3393eb4e59cce18a872ba823 \
  --rpc-url https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@rpc-andante.tempoxyz.dev
```
```bash
# Output: transaction traces
Executing previous transactions from the block.
Traces:
  [1000] AlphaUSD::transfer(0xDf37F81dAAD2b0327A0A50003740e1C935C70913, 10)
    └─ ← [Return] true


Transaction successfully executed.
Gas used: 22560
```

This command replays all transactions in the block up to and including the specified transaction, showing:
- Function calls with parameters
- Return values
- Gas usage
- Internal contract interactions


## Interact with TIP20 tokens

### Check Token Metadata

Get token metadata using the following commands:

```bash
# Get token symbol: AlphaUSD
cast erc20 symbol 0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
  --rpc-url https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@rpc-andante.tempoxyz.dev
```

```bash
# Get token decimals: 6
cast erc20 decimals 0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
  --rpc-url https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@rpc-andante.tempoxyz.dev
```

### Check Token Balance

Query the balance of any ERC20 token using the `cast erc20 balance` command:

```bash
# Check AlphaUSD balance for an address: 1000000000 [1e9]
cast erc20 balance 0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
                   0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --rpc-url https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@rpc-andante.tempoxyz.dev
```

The output shows the balance in both raw format and scientific notation. In this example, the address has 1,000 AlphaUSD (1,000,000,000 in smallest units with 6 decimals).

### Transfer Tokens

Transfer ERC20 tokens using the `cast erc20 transfer` command:

```bash
# Transfer 100 AlphaUSD tokens (100 * 1e6)
cast erc20 transfer \
  0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
  0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8 \
  100000000 \
  --rpc-url https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@rpc-andante.tempoxyz.dev \
  --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```
```bash
# Output: transaction hash
0x5c7469a9d436516f0c748abdef96fb3628f901cb3393eb4e59cce18a872ba823
```

**Important Notes:**
- Amounts must be specified in the token's smallest unit. AlphaUSD has 6 decimals: `1 AlphaUSD = 1000000` (1e6)
- The command returns only the transaction hash, not a full receipt
- Ensure you have sufficient token balance before attempting a transfer

## Predeployed Contracts

## Predeployed Tokens

The testnet includes three predeployed stablecoins (all pegged to USD):

| Token | Currency | Address |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **AlphaUSD** | USD | `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001` |
| **BetaUSD** | USD | `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000002` |
| **ThetaUSD** | USD | `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000003` |

<Callout type="info">
  All TIP-20 addresses have been shifted by one. The `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000` address is now reserved for linkingUSD.
</Callout>

## Predeployed Liquidity

The following liquidity is available on the Fee AMM:

- **BetaUSD → AlphaUSD** (10k on each side)
- **ThetaUSD → AlphaUSD** (10k on each side)

These pools enable automatic fee token conversions when users pay gas fees in tokens different from the validator's preferred token.

## Explorer & Tools

For now we have stood up a very basic Blockscout instance to explore the testnet.

| Explorer Parameter         | Value                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Block Explorer**         | `https://andante.cloud.blockscout.com/`          |

Speak to the Tempo team for an explorer username and password.

If there are any tools you rely on we can preconfigure for future testnets, let us know.

## FAQ

### What is the stablecoin exchange address and how do I use it?

The stablecoin exchange is deployed as a precompiled contract at `0xdec0000000000000000000000000000000000000`. You can interact with it directly through the contract interface to execute swaps or provide liquidity. See the [executing swaps](/documentation/exchange/executing-swaps) and [providing liquidity](/documentation/exchange/providing-liquidity) documentation for detailed instructions.

Note that there is no web interface for the exchange in this release, but one is being actively worked on. If you're interested in building tooling or providing feedback on the exchange, we'd love to hear from you!

### What is linkingUSD?

linkingUSD is a system-level TIP-20 token that acts as a common accounting unit for the stablecoin exchange. Instead of creating separate liquidity pools for every stablecoin pair, liquidity providers deposit their stablecoins into pools paired with linkingUSD. This design enables efficient multi-hop trading and unified liquidity across all stablecoin markets. Learn more in the [linkingUSD documentation](/documentation/tokens/linkingUSD).

### Do regular EOAs (externally owned accounts) still work with native account abstraction?

Yes! Native account abstraction on Tempo is fully backward compatible with traditional EOAs.

You can continue using your existing wallets and accounts exactly as you would on any other EVM chain. The account abstraction features are available as an additional transaction type that unlocks advanced capabilities like batch transactions, fee sponsorship, and passkey authentication, but standard EOA transactions continue to work as expected.

### Will my contracts from the previous testnet work on Andante?

No. Andante is a brand new network with no history from past testnets. You will need to redeploy your contracts and update any integration code to work with the new testnet. We anticipate that by release #6 we will no longer be starting a new testnet each time.

### Where do I report bugs or get help?

Please use the Tempo Slack channels for bug reports, questions, and support. Our team actively monitors these channels and will help you troubleshoot any issues you encounter on the testnet.
