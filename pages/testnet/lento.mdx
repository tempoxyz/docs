# Lento [The third Tempo testnet]

## What's New

Lento is our third Tempo testnet, released on October 6th. It includes the following features:

### Payment Lanes
[Payment lanes](/documentation/transactions/payment-lanes) ensure that payment transactions always have available blockspace, even during periods of high network congestion. This is achieved through separate gas limits for payment and non-payment transactions, creating guaranteed capacity for payments. For full implementation details, see the [payment lanes specs](/protocol/transactions/payments-lane).

### Fee Token Flexibility
Users can now specify which stablecoin to use for transaction fees on a transaction-by-transaction basis. While you can [set a default fee token](documentation/transactions/fee-tokens#set-a-default-fee-token) for your account, each transaction can override this preference by [specifying a different fee token](/documentation/transactions/fee-tokens#specify-fee-token-per-transaction) directly in the transaction object. The fee token parameter is part of the transaction object and is optional, as detailed in the [fee token specs](/protocol/transactions/fee-tokens#transaction-level).

### Fee Sponsorship
Accounts can now sponsor the gas costs of another account. [Fee sponsorship](/documentation/transactions/fee-sponsorship) enables gasless transactions where one account (the fee payer) pays transaction fees on behalf of another account (the sender). This is perfect for onboarding new users or subsidizing transactions for your application's users. Gas sponsorship is implemented at the transaction level, where the gas payer can simply sign a message over the transaction object to sponsor the gas costs, and have that submitted inside a `feePayerSignature` field [as specified in the fee payer specs](/protocol/transactions/fee-payers#how-it-works).

### Consensus Engine Update

The Lento testnet is now running a new consensus algorithm instead of running as a single-node network as in Adagio and Adagietto testnets. This is an alpha integration of an alpha piece of software, so things might break during this testnet. Read more about our approach to blockchain consensus on Tempo [here](/protocol/consensus).

For now we have stood up a very basic Blockscout instance to explore the testnet.

| Explorer Parameter         | Value                                           |

Speak to the Tempo team for an explorer username and password.

If there are any tools you rely on we can preconfigure for future testnets, let us know.
