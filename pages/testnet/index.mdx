# Testnet Overview

Thank you for your support as we build Tempo!

We're building Tempo in close collaboration with great design partners that have production use cases using stablecoins today. Our development philosophy is to iterate rapidly with frequent feedback from our design partners.

We're rolling out a series of testnets, each introducing new features as we continue to develop Tempo. Each testnet page contains:
- **Connection Information**: RPC URLs, chain IDs, and network details
- **Features Released**: What's new in each testnet version
- **Faucet Usage**: How to get test tokens for development
- **Predeployed Contracts**: Available contracts and their addresses

All testnets up until public testnet focus on showcasing specific features of Tempo, e.g. payment lanes, native AA, gas paid in stablecoins and more. The testnets are fully functional and compatible with the EVM, so we recommend playing around with the new features.

For detailed documentation, see the [docs](/documentation). For an in-depth understanding of the protocol, see the [protocol specifications](/protocol).
