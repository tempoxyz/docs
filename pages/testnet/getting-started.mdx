# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Before you start testing on Tempo, you'll need to set up a few things.

### Getting a Test Account

For testing purposes, you'll need a private key. The easiest way to is use `cast` from Foundry to generate a new ephemeral test account:

:::warning
This account is for testing purposes only. Do not use this account for any real funds or sensitive operations.
:::

:::info
If you don't have Foundry installed yet, follow the [Foundry installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/) first.
:::

```bash [Terminal]
cast wallet new

# Successfully created new keypair.
# Address:     <YOUR_ADDRESS>
# Private key: <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

For more details, see the [`Foundry` documentation on `cast wallet`](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/reference/wallet/).

### Getting Faucet Tokens

To interact with the testnet, you'll need test tokens. Each testnet has a built-in faucet that can fund your address with test stablecoins.

See the faucet instructions for each testnet:

- [Andante (Testnet #4)](/testnet/andante#faucet)
- [Lento (Testnet #3)](/testnet/lento#faucet)
- [Adagietto (Testnet #2)](/testnet/adagietto#faucet)
- [Adagio (Testnet #1)](/testnet/adagio#using-the-faucet)

Example faucet usage:

```bash [Terminal]
cast rpc tempo_fundAddress <YOUR_ADDRESS> --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz
```

## Interacting with Tempo using Foundry

The easiest way to programatically interact with Tempo is by using [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/), a blazing-fast toolkit for EVM networks.

Follow the [instructions](/tooling/#foundry) to get started.
