# FAQ

## I don't see a balance on my wallet, even though I've funded it

The Tempo testnets do not have a native currency, instead [gas can be paid in stablecoins](/documentation/transactions/fee-tokens).
MetaMask and other wallets currently do not support these tokens out-of-the-box, so to see the balance, you may need to add the tokens manually.

## What is the max TPS of the Tempo testnets?

The current private testnets do not focus on maximizing throughput (although some features are dedicated to that). Instead, the testnets
are a way for our partners to test our new features and their compatibility with their products.

## What is the reliability of the Tempo RPCs?

The current testnets are operated on a best-effort basis. We do not guarantee uptime or availability, but we strive to provide a reliable service.
If we do plan maintenance, we will make sure to notify our partners and users in advance.
