# Tokenized Deposits

Financial institutions can adopt instant, global, and 24/7 money movement by tokenizing their existing deposits. This enables their customers to transact during weekends, and with tokenized deposits, the settlement is instantaneous. This may reduce risk (and cost) in many industries like payments and be highly desirable for many Fortune 500s managing their supply chain or market risk.

Tempo is being designed to support the highly complex combination of compliance and privacy requirements financial institutions require to operate with confidence and scale.
