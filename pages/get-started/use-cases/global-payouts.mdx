# Global Payouts

Businesses often need to pay customers or employees with one-off transactions on an infrequent basis (e.g., a paycheck). In this scenario, they'll often have a low volume of such payments. Traditional payment networks can be an expensive and slow option, whereas stablecoins can be instant and low cost. This is especially popular in markets with hyperinflation or where the local currency is not widely traded.

Tempo natively supports batched and scheduled transactions, enabling a payroll run every two weeks or monthly to operate on a "set and forget" basis directly in the network.
