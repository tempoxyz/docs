# Embedded Finance and Card Issuing

Embedded payments, lending, and cards have become major revenue streams for marketplaces and platforms. Stablecoins are operating as a platform to build new financial products such as stablecoin-linked cards. For developers, these cards are often available in markets they couldn't previously access, and, in the case of credit, can be lower-risk through instant settlement from card networks.

At-scale platforms and marketplaces require robust performance from their embedded finance offerings, and backward compatibility with their existing systems of record and bank partners. Tempo is designed to offer reconciliation (through memos) and compliance hooks to ensure payments products can balance the tension of being lower cost and faster, with being highly compliant and scalable.
