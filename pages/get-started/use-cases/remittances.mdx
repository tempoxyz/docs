# Remittances

Global, 24/7 transfers have become a major use case for stablecoins, as users in the global south value access to hold, spend, and send a stable currency. Tempo enables cross-border settlement to any wallet, in any stablecoin. At launch, Tempo is designed to support all fiat stablecoins and tokenized deposits.

Tempo's ultra-low, predictable fees and ability to support gas in any stablecoin make remittances much more performant for any developer interfacing with stablecoins. There's no competition from network traffic (such as airdrops or memecoin launches): payments get dedicated blockspace.
