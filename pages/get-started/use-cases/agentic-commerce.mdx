# Agentic Commerce

Autonomous agents and AI models will increasingly interact and transact with each other, requiring instant, verifiable settlement and programmatic payment logic. Tempo provides this through programmatic payments that settle instantly onchain. These come with cryptographic proof of settlement, allowing mutually unknown agents to ensure audit and reconciliation can be completed.

Tempo achieves this through memo fields, allowing agents to embed rich structured data (like invoice IDs, service metadata, or conditional payment instructions). A single agent can also sponsor gas fees for other agents to simplify orchestration or batch transactions to pay multiple specialized AIs.
