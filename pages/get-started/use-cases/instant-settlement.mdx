# Instant Settlement

Transactions on Tempo have a finality of approximately one second. This speed means consumers, businesses, and payments companies can spend or manage cash immediately. It lowers risk in the system and reduces the overall cost and complexity of managing cross-border and domestic transactions.

Tempo's high throughput (targeting 100,000 TPS) and dedicated blockspace add predictability to this speed. This predictability and robustness will be critical for at-scale payments transactions to come onto the network.
