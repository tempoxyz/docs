# Connect to Tempo

## Tempo Mainnet (Presto)

Tempo's mainnet is not yet available and is scheduled for launch in 2026.

If you'd like to be a design partner, please send us an email at [partners@tempo.xyz](mailto:partners@tempo.xyz). If you'd like to join the team and help us with the launch, check out our job posting [here](https://tempo.xyz/careers).

## Tempo Testnet (Andantino)

| Network Parameter | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| **Network Name** | Tempo Testnet (Andante) |
| **Description** | A testnet for developers to experiment with Tempo's features |
| **Currency** | USD |
| **Chain ID** | `64165` |
| **RPC URL** | `https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz` |
| **Block Explorer** | `https://explorer.testnet.tempo.xyz` |

Note that the RPC URL is authenticated with a username and password. You can get these credentials from the Tempo team directly if you're currently an infrastructure partner.

## Add Network to MetaMask

You can add Tempo testnet to MetaMask manually:

1. Open MetaMask and click on the menu in the top right and select 'Networks'
2. Click 'Add a custom network'
3. Enter the network details:
   - **Network Name**: `Tempo Testnet`
   - **RPC URL**: `https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz`
   - **Chain ID**: `64165`
   - **Currency Symbol**: `USD`
   - **Block Explorer URL**: `https://explorer.testnet.tempo.xyz`
4. Click 'Save' to add the network

The official documentation from MetaMask on this process is also available [here](https://support.metamask.io/configure/networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc#adding-a-network-manually).

<Callout type="warning">
Note that we recommend using the symbol "USD" for the currency symbol, despite there being no native gas token. Legacy wallets like MetaMask don't natively support the Tempo network yet, so there are some quirks to the interface.
