# Payment Features

Tempo is a blockchain optimized for payments. Rather than being a general-purpose platform where payments compete with all other applications, Tempo's architecture prioritizes the reliability, predictability, and user experience that real-world payment systems demand.

## Predictable fees, payable in any stablecoin

On many blockchains today, there's a "noisy neighbor" problem where blockspace can be bid up during times of intense activity—think popular new token launches, DeFi arbitrage during volatility, or NFT drops. This creates situations where basic payments can't get through the network, or suddenly become prohibitively expensive.

Tempo solves this with dedicated payment lanes. We've segmented blockspace so that payment transactions (specifically, TIP-20 token transfers) have reserved capacity that other applications cannot consume. Even if there are extremely popular applications on the chain competing for blockspace, your payroll run or customer disbursement will execute predictably.

Additionally, Tempo has no native gas token. Users pay transaction fees directly in the same USD stablecoin they're transacting with. A Fee AMM automatically handles conversion between the user's chosen stablecoin and the validator's preferred token. This means users only need to hold one token, and costs are predictable: TIP-20 transfers cost less than $0.001.

## Reconciliation built-in with transfer memos

In traditional payment systems, every transaction carries context—an invoice number, a customer ID, a cost center, or a simple reference note. This metadata is essential for backend systems to automatically match incoming payments to internal records.

Standard ERC-20 tokens don't have a way to attach this information. Businesses end up building custom solutions, maintaining off-chain databases, or simply doing manual reconciliation.

Tempo's TIP-20 tokens include native `transferWithMemo()` functions that attach a 32-byte memo directly to each transfer. For larger memos, the protocol supports flexible approaches where only a commitment (like a hash or locator) travels on-chain while the full data lives off-chain.

```solidity
ITIP20(token).transferWithMemo(recipient, amount, invoiceId);
```

This means finance teams can automatically match payments to invoices, payment processors can embed the structured data their systems need, and developers don't need to build custom reconciliation infrastructure.

## Compliance built-in with transfer policies

Stablecoin issuers operate under regulatory requirements. They need to enforce whitelists (only approved addresses can transact) or blacklists (sanctioned addresses cannot transact). Traditionally, every token implements these features independently, and updating policies means updating dozens of contracts one by one.

Tempo provides a shared compliance infrastructure through the TIP-403 Policy Registry. An issuer can create a single policy with their compliance rules, and multiple tokens can adopt that policy. When the compliance manager updates the policy, all tokens using it automatically enforce the new rules.

This is particularly valuable for issuers operating multiple stablecoins or tokens across different jurisdictions—they can manage their entire token family's compliance from a single policy.

## Native functionality for batching payments

Payment processors and platforms often need to send thousands of payments at once—payroll runs, merchant settlements, customer refunds. On traditional blockchains, this means thousands of separate transactions, each paying gas individually.

Tempo's native account abstraction enables batch transactions where multiple operations execute atomically in a single transaction. The protocol also supports concurrent transaction processing from the same account, removing the sequential bottleneck that limits throughput in classic EVM accounts.

This unlocks high-volume use cases: orchestrators can submit thousands of payouts as a single operation, streaming payments become practical, and real-time payment flows are achievable.

## Native gas sponsorship for covering transaction fees

Applications often want to pay transaction fees on behalf of their users—to simplify onboarding, to improve the user experience, or to remove friction from their payment flows. Traditional blockchains don't provide a standard way to do this.

Tempo's protocol-level fee sponsorship allows an account to sign a transaction while a separate sponsor (typically the application) pays the gas fee. The user never needs to hold gas tokens, and the application has complete control over its UX.

## Simplified payment scheduling built-in

Recurring payments like payroll, subscriptions, or scheduled disbursements typically require manual execution or off-chain automation infrastructure. There's no native way to say "execute this transaction on the 15th of every month."

Tempo's account abstraction transaction type includes scheduling as a protocol feature. Users can specify a time window for transaction execution, and validators will include the transaction when it becomes valid.

This enables "set and forget" payment operations directly at the protocol level, without requiring external scheduling services.

## High throughput transactions with instant finality

Payment systems require both speed and certainty. A merchant needs to know immediately that a payment has settled. A payroll system processing thousands of transactions needs guaranteed throughput without waiting for confirmations or worrying about reversals.

Traditional blockchains struggle with this. Proof-of-work chains require waiting for multiple confirmations—often 10+ minutes—before transactions are considered final. Even modern proof-of-stake chains use probabilistic finality where blocks can potentially be reorganized, forcing applications to wait for "enough" confirmations before trusting a transaction.

Tempo uses a bleeding-edge consensus algorithm that provides instant finality. When a transaction is included in a block, it's cryptographically final within one second—no reorganizations possible, no waiting for confirmations. Combined with high-performance execution software built on Reth, Tempo achieves tens of thousands of transactions per second in testing, with a clear path to 100,000+ TPS as the system matures.

This means payment applications get both the throughput and the settlement certainty they need. Process payroll for thousands of employees in a single transaction. Settle cross-border payments in seconds with immediate finality. Build real-time payment flows without worrying about confirmation delays.

## Native support for modern wallet authentication

Asking users to secure a 12 or 24-word seed phrase is a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. A single mistake means permanent loss of funds, and the mental model is unfamiliar to most people.

Tempo supports passkey authentication through WebAuthn/P256 signature validation, built directly into the protocol's account abstraction. Users can authenticate with the same biometrics (fingerprint, Face ID) they already use for other apps. Their keys are stored in their device's secure enclave, and passkeys sync across devices via iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager.

This means users get familiar authentication they already understand, with built-in recovery options, and no secure storage burden.

## Native private token standard for stablecoin issuers

:::warning[Coming Soon]
Tempo is developing opt-in privacy features designed to coexist with issuer compliance requirements. This functionality will enable private balances and transfers while maintaining the auditability and reporting capabilities that regulated issuers need.
:::

When available, private tokens will enable sensitive business transactions, confidential consumer balances, and privacy-preserving payment flows—all while preserving the compliance features that make stablecoins viable in regulated markets.
