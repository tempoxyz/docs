# Validator Network

Tempo's validator network is built on transparent economics and decentralized infrastructure. Validators earn revenue directly from transaction activity while participating in a system designed to prevent centralization and ensure fair access to blockspace.

## Reserved blockspace for validators

Traditional blockchain architectures grant the block proposer complete control over transaction inclusion. This creates centralization risks: a proposer can censor transactions, extract MEV exclusively, or include only their own transactions.

Tempo partitions each block's gas limit across multiple validators. Beyond the payment lane reservation, the remaining gas is split into validator sub-blocks and proposer space.

Every validator in the active set receives a fixed gas allocation they exclusively control—their validator sub-block. Validators can include transactions in their allocated sub-block regardless of whether they're the proposer for that block. This distributes transaction inclusion power across the validator set rather than concentrating it in a single actor per block.

The block proposer gets the remaining gas after payment lane and validator sub-block allocations. They control this "proposer space" but cannot fill validator sub-blocks or prevent other validators from using their allocations.

Validators cannot exceed their sub-block allocation, and they cannot consume gas reserved for the payment lane. The proposer cannot fill validator sub-blocks or prevent validators from using their allocations.

## Validator economics: revenue from network usage

Becoming a Tempo validator is an opportunity to earn revenue from network activity. Validators generate income from transactions and priority fees, representing a transparent and predictable revenue stream tied to network usage.

At launch, Tempo operates without a native token, staking rewards, or inflationary incentives. This means validator earnings come entirely from organic transaction demand. Validators earn from three sources: base fees (a flat network fee of ~$0.001 per TIP-20 transfer), priority fees (optional user tips during congestion), and MEV opportunities (minor reordering, flow matching, or cross-DEX arbitrage where permitted).

There is no token issuance or shared pool. All fees in a block are paid directly to the proposing validator's account on L1, in the validator's preferred token. The Fee AMM automatically converts user fees into whatever stablecoin the validator wants to receive.

This creates strong economic alignment: validators benefit from network growth and are incentivized to maintain reliable infrastructure that attracts payment applications. As the network scales, validator revenue grows proportionally with transaction volume.

Tempo does not implement slashing or require validators to post collateral. Revenue opportunity comes from uptime and participation—validators who maintain reliable infrastructure earn consistently, while those with poor uptime simply miss block proposals and the associated fees.
