# Getting Started

Tempo distributes a Rust SDK in the form of an [Alloy](https://alloy.rs) crate. Alloy is 
a popular Rust crate for interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains.

The Tempo Alloy crate can be used to perform common operations with the chain, such as:
 querying the chain, sending Tempo transactions, managing tokens & their AMM pools, and more.
