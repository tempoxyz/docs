# Install

Set up your development environment and deploy contracts to Tempo.

## Install Foundry

Tempo uses a custom fork of Foundry that supports protocol-level features like custom precompiles, new transaction types, and native account abstraction.

:::warning
Use Tempo's Foundry fork for compatibility. Standard Foundry won't work with Tempo-specific features.
:::

### Prerequisites

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### Install Tempo Foundry

Run the following command to install the Tempo fork of Foundry:

```bash
foundryup -n tempo
```

This will install the latest `nightly` release of the Tempo fork.

To install a specific version, replace `<TAG_NAME>` with the desired release tag:

```bash
foundryup -n tempo -i <TAG_NAME>
```

#### Verify Installation

```bash
forge --version
cast --version
```

You should see version information include `-tempo`, indicating you are using the Tempo fork.
