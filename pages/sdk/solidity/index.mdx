# Getting Started

Tempo builds on top of [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry): the leading Ethereum development toolkit, through a custom fork that adds first-class support for Tempo.

This fork extends Foundry with Tempo's [protocol-level features](/protocol/) like custom precompiles, new transaction types and native account abstraction. This enables developers to build, test, and deploy contracts that go [beyond the limits of standard EVM chains](/get-started/quickstart/evm-compatibility).

## Install Foundry

:::warning
Use Tempo's Foundry fork for compatibility. Standard Foundry won't work with Tempo-specific features.
:::

### Prerequisites

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### Install Tempo Foundry

Run the following command to install the Tempo fork of Foundry:

```bash
foundryup -n tempo
```

This will install the latest `nightly` release of the Tempo fork.

To install a specific version, replace `<TAG_NAME>` with the desired release tag:

```bash
foundryup -n tempo -i <TAG_NAME>
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
forge --version
cast --version
```

You should see version information include `-tempo`, indicating you are using the Tempo fork.
