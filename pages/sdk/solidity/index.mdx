# Getting Started

Tempo builds on top of [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry): the leading Ethereum development toolkit, through a custom fork that adds first-class support for Tempo.

This fork extends Foundry with Tempo's [protocol-level features](/protocol/), enabling developers to build, test, and deploy contracts that go [beyond the limits of standard EVM chains](/get-started/network-information/evm-compatibility).
