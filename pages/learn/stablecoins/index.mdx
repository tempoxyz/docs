# What are Stablecoins?

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset, typically the US dollar.

## Types of Stablecoins

### Fiat-Backed
- Backed 1:1 by fiat currency reserves
- Examples: USDC, USDT
- Most common type

### Crypto-Backed
- Backed by cryptocurrency collateral
- Over-collateralized to handle volatility
- Example: DAI

### Algorithmic
- Maintain peg through algorithmic mechanisms
- No direct collateral backing
- Higher risk profile
