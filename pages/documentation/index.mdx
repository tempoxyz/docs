# Tempo Documentation

## What is Tempo?

Tempo is a Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for global payments. 
Unlike general-purpose blockchains, every aspect of Tempo is optimized for the specific needs of real-world payment systems: low and predictable costs, stablecoin flexibility, built-in compliance, and payment-grade user experience.

## Key Concepts

### Payment-Optimized Tokens

[TIP-20 tokens](/documentation/tokens) are Tempo's standard for stablecoins and payment tokens. They extend ERC-20 with features that payments actually need:

- **Transfer policies** for compliance and access control
- **Role-based permissions** separating governance from issuance
- **Memo support** for attaching payment references
- **Currency awareness** with automatic decimal handling

Any stablecoin issuer can deploy a TIP-20 token permissionlessly.

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [**Overview**](/documentation/tokens) | Understand TIP-20's payment-focused features |
| [**Creating Tokens**](/documentation/tokens/creating-tokens) | Create a new TIP-20 token using the factory contract |
| [**Roles & Permissions**](/documentation/tokens/roles) | Configure who can mint, burn, pause, and manage tokens |
| [**Minting & Burning**](/documentation/tokens/minting) | Issue new supply and destroy tokens from circulation |
| [**Transfer Policies**](/documentation/tokens/policies) | Implement compliance rules and access controls |

### Flexible Payments

On Tempo, you can **pay transaction fees in any USD-denominated stablecoin** with sufficient liquidity. No need to hold or manage a native token.

The protocol uses an enshrined [Fee AMM](/documentation/transactions/fee-amm) to convert your chosen stablecoin to the validator's preferred token automatically. You specify your fee token preference at the transaction level, account level, or let it default to the validator's choice.

For apps, [fee sponsorship](/documentation/transactions/fee-sponsorship) enables completely gasless user experiences, and a third-party can pay fees on behalf of users.

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [**Overview**](/documentation/transactions) | Tempo's payment-optimized transaction types |
| [**Fee Tokens**](/documentation/transactions/fee-tokens) | Choose which stablecoin to pay fees with |
| [**Fee Sponsorship**](/documentation/transactions/fee-sponsorship) | Let third parties pay transaction fees for users |
| [**Payment Lanes**](/documentation/transactions/payment-lanes) | Reserved blockspace for payment transactions |
| [**Batch Transactions**](/documentation/transactions/batch-transactions) | Execute multiple operations atomically in one transaction |

### Built-In Stablecoin Exchange

Tempo includes an enshrined DEX designed specifically for cross-stablecoin payments. Unlike traditional AMMs, it uses an onchain order book optimized to minimize MEV while providing optimal pricing for users.

- **Price-time priority** – Orders execute in a fair, deterministic order
- **Flip orders** – Passive liquidity that automatically flips sides when filled, reducing message volume and making market making easier
- **MEV protection** – Order placements are delayed until the end of the block, preventing JIT and backrunning strategies
- **Low latency takes** – Trades against existing orders execute immediately
- **Payment-focused** – Designed for stable pairs (e.g., `USDC ↔ USDT`) with tight spreads, not volatile trading

The DEX enables cross-stablecoin payments – users can send USDC while recipients receive USDT, all in a single transaction.

### "Smarter" Native Accounts

Every account on Tempo is delegated to a ["Default Account Abstraction"](/documentation/accounts) precompile. 
Regular externally-owned accounts (EOAs) automatically gain "smart" account capabilities on first use, with
no need to perform manual upgrades.

- **Batched transactions** – Execute multiple operations atomically
- **Arbitrary signature verification** – Verify signatures via Passkeys (WebAuthn), P256, or standard Secp256k1 curves
- **Custom logic** – Add recovery mechanisms, spending limits, or multisig

### Dedicated Payment Infrastructure

Tempo includes protocol-level features designed specifically for high-volume payments:

- **Payment Lanes**: Guaranteed blockspace for payment transactions, isolated from general activity
- **Optimized throughput**: Architecture focused on maximizing payment processing capacity
- **Predictable costs**: Fee mechanisms designed for stability, not speculation
