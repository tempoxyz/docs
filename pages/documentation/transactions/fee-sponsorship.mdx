# Fee Sponsorship

## How it Works

Fee sponsorship allows one account (the **fee payer**) to pay transaction fees on behalf of another account (the **sender**). This enables gasless transactions where users can interact with the blockchain without holding any tokens to pay for gas.

::::steps
### Sender signs the transaction

The sender signs the transaction with their private key, signing over a **blank fee token field**. This means the sender delegates the choice of which fee token to use to the fee payer.

### Fee payer selects and signs

The fee payer selects which fee token to use, then signs over the transaction.

### Transaction submission

The fee token and fee payer signature is added to the transaction using the `feePayerSignature` fieldand is then submitted.

### Network validation

The network validates both signatures and executes the transaction.
