# Creating Tokens

Creating a TIP-20 token on Tempo is achieved by calling the TIP-20 factory contract.

The process deploys a new token with compliance features, role-based permissions, and integration with Tempo's payment infrastructure.

## Example

Create a new token by calling the `createToken` function on the `TIP20Factory` contract.

```solidity
TIP20Factory factory = TIP20Factory(0x20Fc000000000000000000000000000000000000);

TIP20 token = factory.createToken(
  "My Company USD",  // name
  "MCUSD",           // symbol
  "USD",             // currency
  TIP20(0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000), // quoteToken (linkingUSD)
  msg.sender         // admin
);
```

When you create a TIP-20 token, you interact with the `TIP20Factory` precompiled contract deployed at a fixed address. The factory:

1. **Validates your parameters** (currency code, quote token, etc.)
2. **Deploys a new TIP-20 contract** at a deterministic vanity address
3. **Grants admin role** to your specified address
4. **Sets up default states** (transfer policy, supply cap, pause state)
5. **Emits a `TokenCreated` event** with the new token's address and ID


## Details

### Predictable Addresses

Each TIP-20 token is deployed to a predictable address following this pattern:

```
0x20C0000000000000000000000000<tokenId>
```

The token ID is an incrementing counter managed by the factory, making token addresses easily identifiable as TIP-20 tokens. For example, token ID `1` deploys to `0x20C0000000000000000000000000000000000001`.

### Quote Tokens

Every TIP-20 token has a **quote token** that determines which token it is directly quoted again on the built-in DEX

Most USD stablecoins use [linkingUSD](/documentation/exchange/linkingUSD) at `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000` as their quote token.
:::warning
Quote tokens cannot be changed after creation. Choose carefully based on your expected liquidity and trading needs.
:::

### Currency & Decimals

- The `currency` parameter is an arbitrary string (e.g., "USD", "EUR").
- All TIP-20 tokens use 6 decimals.
- If a token's `currency` is "USD", its `quoteToken` must also be a USD token.


### Roles & Permissions

The **admin role** is granted to the address you specified.
It can grant/revoke other roles, change transfer policies, and set supply caps.

:::warning
Note: You will need to [grant roles](/documentation/tokens/roles) for minting, burning, etc, including the admin provided to the `createToken` function.

### Default State

| Setting | Default Value | Description |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Transfer Policy** | `1` (always-allow) | Anyone can send/receive tokens |
| **Supply Cap** | Unlimited | No maximum token supply |
| **Total Supply** | `0` | No tokens exist yet - must be minted |
| **Paused** | `false` | Transfers are enabled |

## Next Steps

After creating your token, you can now:

1. **[Grant the issuer role](/documentation/tokens/roles)** to addresses that can mint tokens
2. **[Mint initial supply](/documentation/tokens/controlling-supply)** to distribute tokens
3. **[Configure transfer policies](/documentation/tokens/transfer-policies)** if compliance is required
4. **[Add DEX liquidity](#TODO)** so users can trade your token
