## What are TIP-20 Tokens?

[TIP-20](/protocol/tokens/tip-20) is Tempo's token standard for stablecoins and payment tokens. 
While similar to ERC-20, TIP-20 tokens are purpose-built for real-world payments with features that make them compliant, controllable, and compatible with Tempo's unique fee system.

### Why TIP-20?

Traditional ERC-20 tokens are great for DeFi, but payments need more:

- **Built-in compliance**: Transfer policies let issuers control who can send and receive tokens, meeting regulatory requirements
- **Controlled issuance**: Role-based permissions separate who can manage tokens from who can issue (mint or burn) them
- **Payment metadata**: Attach memos to transfers for payment references, invoice IDs, or transaction notes
- **Stablecoin-first**: Currency codes (like `USD`, `EUR`, `JPY`) determine decimal precision automatically
- **Fee flexibility**: Can be used to pay transaction fees on Tempo, swapped automatically through the built-in Fee AMM

### Features

Every TIP-20 token includes:

- **Roles & Permissions**: Grant specific addresses the ability to mint, burn, pause, or manage your token
- **Transfer Policies**: Control who can transfer tokens using the TIP-403 registry
- **Supply Management**: Set caps on total supply, mint to issuers, or burn from blocked addresses
- **Memo Support**: Include 32-byte memos with transfers for payment tracking
- **Currency Awareness**: Tokens know their currency (`USD`, `EUR`, etc.) and use the correct decimal precision
