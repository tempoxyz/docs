# linkingUSD

linkingUSD is the root quote token used by USD stablecoins on Tempo's decentralized exchange.

## Overview

linkingUSD is a non-transferable, USD-denominated accounting unit that serves as the common quote token for all USD stablecoins on the exchange. It exists to:

- **Concentrate liquidity** - All USD stablecoins trade against linkingUSD, preventing liquidity fragmentation
- **Maintain neutrality** - No specific issuer's token is privileged as the base quote
- **Simplify routing** - Direct trading pairs between stablecoins without complex routing
- **Reduce slippage** - Concentrated liquidity improves price discovery and minimizes slippage

## Properties

- **Address**: `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- **Non-transferable**: Cannot be transferred between accounts or used as a standard stablecoin
- **Quote token only**: Used exclusively for exchange accounting and order books

## How It Works

When you create a USD stablecoin on Tempo, you typically set linkingUSD as its quote token:

```solidity
TIP20 token = factory.createToken(
  "My Company USD",
  "MCUSD",
  "USD",
  TIP20(0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000), // linkingUSD
  msg.sender
);
```

This means:
- Your token trades against linkingUSD on the exchange
- Users can swap between your token and other USD stablecoins that also use linkingUSD
- All liquidity is concentrated in linkingUSD pairs

## Why Non-Transferable?

linkingUSD is designed as an accounting unit, not a circulating stablecoin. This design:
- Prevents it from being used outside the exchange
- Ensures it serves purely as a neutral reference point
- Avoids regulatory complexity of issuing a transferable USD stablecoin
