# Default Accounts

Accounts on Tempo are by default just regular Ethereum-style externally owned accounts (EOAs). You can use standard wallets like MetaMask, hardware wallets, or any tool that works with Ethereum. However, there are a few important differences to be aware of:

## No Native Token

Tempo does not have a native token like ETH. This means certain Ethereum operations don't make sense and will not work as expected:

| Feature | Difference |
|---------|------------|
| **`eth_balance` RPC calls** | Since there's no native token, checking the "ETH balance" of an account doesn't apply. For compatability reasons, they return 424242424242... |
| **EVM `BALANCE` and `SELFBALANCE` opcodes** | These opcodes (and therefore `address(this).balance` in Solidity) will not return any sort of native token balance.  |
| **Transaction fees** | Instead of paying gas in ETH, you pay fees in supported stablecoins. See the [Fees](/documentation/fees) section for details |

## Native Account Abstraction Transactions

Accounts can submit a special "account abstraction transaction" type that provides smart contract-style functionality without deploying a contract. This includes:

- **Batch transactions** - Execute multiple operations atomically
- **Passkey signatures** - Sign with WebAuthn/P256 instead of secp256k1
- **Gas sponsorship** - Allow third parties to pay transaction fees
- **Parallel nonces** - Send multiple transactions simultaneously

For complete details on these capabilities, see the [Sending Transactions](/documentation/transactions) section.

## Default Account Abstraction (Experimental)

There is currently an experimental feature that automatically converts accounts to smart contract wallets on their first transaction using [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702).

:::warning
**Note: This feature will likely be deprecated before mainnet launch.** We recommend using the standard account abstraction transaction type instead if you need smart contract functionality.

### Opting Out (If Enabled)

If you want to opt out of automatic delegation while this feature is still active, you can undelegate using standard EIP-7702 mechanisms:

:::code-group
```ts [optOut.ts]
// Undelegate (revert to plain EOA)
const authorization = client.signAuthorization({
  address: zeroAddress,
})

// Or delegate to a different implementation
const authorization = client.signAuthorization({
  address: '0xdeadbeefcafebabedeadbeefcafebabedeadbeef',
})

// Broadcast changes
const hash = await client.sendTransaction({
  authorizationList: [authorization],
})
```

```ts [viem.config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/setup.ts:setup]
```
