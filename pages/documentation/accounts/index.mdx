# Default Accounts

Accounts on Tempo are regular Ethereum-style externally owned accounts (EOAs) compatible with standard wallets like MetaMask and hardware wallets.

:::info 
Current Testnet Implementation  
EOAs are automatically delegated to a default smart contract implementation using [Default Account Abstraction (DAA)](/protocol/default-accounts). DAA will be deprecated in the next release in favor of [AATransaction (Type 0x76)](/protocol/transactions/aa-transaction).

There are a few important differences to be aware of:

## No Native Token

Tempo does not have a native token like ETH. This means certain Ethereum operations don't make sense and will not work as expected:

| Feature | Difference |
|---------|------------|
| **`eth_balance` RPC calls** | Since there's no native token, checking the "ETH balance" of an account doesn't apply. For compatability reasons, they return 424242424242... |
| **EVM `BALANCE` and `SELFBALANCE` opcodes** | These opcodes (and therefore `address(this).balance` in Solidity) will not return any sort of native token balance.  |
| **Transaction fees** | Instead of paying gas in ETH, you pay fees in supported stablecoins. See the [Fees](/documentation/fees) section for details |

## Native Account Abstraction Transactions

Accounts can submit a special "account abstraction transaction" type that provides smart contract-style functionality without deploying a contract. This includes:

- **Batch transactions** - Execute multiple operations atomically
- **Passkey signatures** - Sign with WebAuthn/P256 instead of secp256k1
- **Gas sponsorship** - Allow third parties to pay transaction fees
- **Parallel nonces** - Send multiple transactions simultaneously

For complete details on these capabilities, see the [Sending Transactions](/documentation/transactions) section.
