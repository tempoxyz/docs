# Foundry

The easiest way to interact with Tempo is by using [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/), a blazing-fast toolkit for EVM networks.

### 1. Install Foundry

Since Tempo introduces [several protocol-level features](/documentation/deviations-from-ethereum) that extend beyond Ethereum's vanilla EVM implementation—including custom precompiles, new transaction types, fee payments in stablecoins, and native account abstraction—a custom `forge` and `cast` built from [Tempo's fork](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-foundry) of [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is required.

:::warning
`anvil` and `chisel` are currently not supported on Tempo.
:::

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the Foundry toolchain installed. If you haven't already:

```bash [Terminal]
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### Installation Steps

::::steps

### 1. Download Precompiled Binaries

Download the latest precompiled binaries for your platform from the [Tempo Foundry releases](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-foundry/releases).

Choose the appropriate binary for your system:

**For Linux (x86_64):**
```bash [Terminal]
# using curl
curl -L https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-foundry/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz

# using github cli
gh release download nightly --repo tempoxyz/tempo-foundry --pattern 'foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz' && tar xzf foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

**For Linux (ARM64):**
```bash [Terminal]
# using curl
curl -L https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-foundry/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_linux_arm64.tar.gz | tar xz

# using github cli
gh release download nightly --repo tempoxyz/tempo-foundry --pattern 'foundry_nightly_linux_arm64.tar.gz' && tar xzf foundry_nightly_linux_arm64.tar.gz
```

**For macOS (Intel):**
```bash [Terminal]
# using curl
curl -L https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-foundry/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz

# using github cli
gh release download nightly --repo tempoxyz/tempo-foundry --pattern 'foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz' && tar xzf foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
```

**For macOS (Apple Silicon):**
```bash [Terminal]
# using curl
curl -L https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-foundry/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_darwin_arm64.tar.gz | tar xz

# using github cli
gh release download nightly --repo tempoxyz/tempo-foundry --pattern 'foundry_nightly_darwin_arm64.tar.gz' && tar xzf foundry_nightly_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

### 2. Install the Binaries

Move the downloaded binaries to your Foundry bin directory:

```bash [Terminal]
mkdir -p ~/.foundry/bin
mv forge cast ~/.foundry/bin/
chmod +x ~/.foundry/bin/forge ~/.foundry/bin/cast
```

:::info
This will overwrite your existing `forge` and `cast` installation in `~/.foundry/bin/`.
:::

Ensure `~/.foundry/bin` is in your PATH. If not already configured, add it:

```bash [Terminal]
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### 3. Verify Installation

Check that `forge` and `cast` are installed correctly:

```bash [Terminal]
forge --version
cast --version
```

You should see version information indicating it was built from the Tempo fork.

::::

### Updating

To update to the latest version of the Tempo fork, simply download and install the latest release following the same steps as the initial installation.

### Switching Back to Standard Forge

If you want to switch back to the standard `forge` installation:

```bash [Terminal]
foundryup
```

### 2a. Initialize a new Project

If you have not initialized a project yet, you can use the `forge init --tempo` command.

If you already have a project, continue to [2b. Add Foundry to an existing Project](#2b-add-foundry-to-an-existing-project).

```bash [Terminal]
forge init --tempo <PROJECT_NAME> && cd <PROJECT_NAME>
```

### 2b. Add Foundry to an existing Project

If you already have an existing contracts project, add a `foundry.toml` file to the root directory.

```toml [foundry.toml]
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]

# See more config options https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/config/README.md#all-options
```

And next run:

```bash [Terminal]
forge install tempoxyz/tempo-std
```

### 4. Build and Test

You will now have a project with [`tempo-std`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-std) installed as a dependency, a collection of helpful contracts and libraries for use with Tempo for Foundry.

Next, you can build and test your contracts using the following commands:

```bash [Terminal]
forge build
forge test
```

### 3. Deploy

Next, we can deploy our contract using the `forge create` or `forge script` command.

To deploy a simple contract using `forge create`:

```bash [Terminal]
forge create src/Mail.sol:Mail --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz --broadcast --interactive --constructor-args <TIP20_TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

Or to deploy using a script with `forge script`:

```bash [Terminal]
forge script src/Mail.s.sol:MailScript --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz --broadcast --interactive
```
