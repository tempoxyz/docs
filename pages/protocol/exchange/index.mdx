# Stablecoin DEX

Tempo includes a native DEX optimized for stablecoin trading.

## Architecture

### AMM Pools
Constant-product pools for instant swaps:
- Low slippage for stable pairs
- Automatic price discovery
- Fee revenue for LPs

### Orderbook
Limit orders for precise execution:
- Maker/taker fees
- Partial fills
- Order cancellation

## Swap Execution

```
User → Router → Best Price Source → Settlement
```

The router automatically finds the best price between AMM and orderbook.

## Pool Types

| Pool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| StableSwap | Optimized for 1:1 pegged assets |
| Weighted | Variable weight pools |
| Fee Pool | ETH/stablecoin for fee payment |
