# TIP-20: Native Token Standard

TIP-20 is a native token standard on Tempo, implemented directly within the Reth client. It is an extension of the ERC-20 standard, designed to address advanced payment and compliance requirements while maintaining full backward compatibility with ERC-20 interfaces.

TIP-20 extends ERC-20 with several advanced features designed for payments and compliance.

It introduces native role-based access control, allowing roles such as pauser, issuer, and burn-blocked to be delegated or revoked as needed for secure token administration. TIP-20 tokens can enforce custom transfer policies by integrating with the [TIP-403 Policy Registry](/protocol/tokens/tip-403), supporting regulatory requirements like whitelisting, blacklisting, and KYC/AML enforcement.

The standard also supports supply cap management, letting authorized roles set or update the maximum token supply. For improved usability, TIP-20 includes native support for [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) permit functionality, enabling gasless approvals via off-chain signatures.

Additionally, it offers `transferWithMemo` for attaching memos to transfers. Finally, TIP-20 features a built-in allowance for the protocol’s FeeManager precompile, allowing transaction fees to be deducted directly in tokens.
