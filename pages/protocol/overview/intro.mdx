# Protocol Overview

## Introduction

Tempo is a modular blockchain protocol that extends Ethereum with native support for programmable tokens, flexible transaction fees, and enshrined account abstraction.

The protocol specifications define the core technical primitives and mechanisms that enable:

- **Programmable Tokens**: Native token standards (TIP-20, TIP-403) with built-in policy enforcement and reward distribution
- **Flexible Fees**: Transaction fee payment in multiple tokens via an enshrined AMM
- **Account Abstraction**: Native support for EIP-7702 delegation and AA transactions (Type 0x76)
- **Stablecoin Exchange**: On-chain orderbook exchange with MEV protection
- **Advanced Blockspace**: Payment lanes and sub-block organization for transaction ordering

## Specification Structure

The protocol specifications are organized into the following sections:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Overview](/protocol/overview/intro) | Protocol introduction and [precompile contract addresses](/protocol/overview/contract-addresses) |
| [Transactions](/protocol/transactions) | Transaction types including AATransaction (0x76) and deprecated FeeTokenTransaction (0x77) |
| [Fees](/protocol/fees/fees) | Fee system and AMM for multi-token fee payment |
| [Token Standards](/protocol/tokens) | TIP-20 core standard, TIP-403 policy registry, and reward distribution |
| [Stablecoin Exchange](/protocol/stablecoin-exchange/stablecoin-exchange) | Enshrined exchange and linkingUSD mechanisms |
| [Blockspace](/protocol/consensus-blockspace/block-format) | Block format, payment lanes, and sub-blocks |
| [Account Abstraction](/protocol/accounts) | Default Account Abstraction (deprecated) |
| [ABI References](/protocol/abi-references) | Application Binary Interface references |

## Audience

These specifications are intended for:
- Protocol developers and auditors
