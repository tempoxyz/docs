# Precompile Contract Addresses

Tempo includes several precompiled contracts that provide core protocol functionality at fixed addresses.

## Core Precompiles

| Address | Contract | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `0x...` | FeeManager | Manages transaction fee payment and token preferences |
| `0x...` | FeeAMM | Automated market maker for fee token conversion |
| `0x...` | StablecoinExchange | Enshrined orderbook exchange |
| `0x...` | TIP20RewardRegistry | Registry for TIP-20 reward distribution |
| `0x...` | TIP403Registry | Policy registry for TIP-403 tokens |

## Usage

Precompiles can be called like regular contracts but are implemented natively in the execution client for gas efficiency.

```solidity
// Example: Calling the FeeManager precompile
IFeeManager feeManager = IFeeManager(FEE_MANAGER_ADDRESS);
feeManager.setFeeToken(token);
```

:::info
Precompile addresses and interfaces are stable across protocol upgrades.
