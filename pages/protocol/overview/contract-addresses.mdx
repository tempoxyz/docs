# Precompile Contract Addresses

Tempo includes several precompiled contracts that provide core protocol functionality at fixed addresses. These contracts are implemented natively in the execution client for gas efficiency and guaranteed availability. Unlike regular contracts that exist at addresses determined by deployment, precompiles occupy reserved addresses known at genesis.
