# LinkingUSD

## Overview

LinkingUSD is a protocol mechanism that provides unified liquidity across different USD stablecoins on Tempo. It enables efficient cross-stablecoin trading by linking liquidity pools.

## Purpose

LinkingUSD addresses the liquidity fragmentation problem that occurs when multiple stablecoin pairs exist. Instead of having separate, isolated liquidity for each pair (USDC/USDT, USDC/USDGLO, USDT/USDGLO, etc.), linkingUSD creates a unified liquidity layer.

## How It Works

LinkingUSD acts as an intermediary token that:
- Connects all USD stablecoin pairs
- Enables indirect routing through a common liquidity pool
- Reduces the number of direct pairs needed
- Improves price discovery across stablecoins

## Benefits

### For Traders
- Better pricing due to concentrated liquidity
- Reduced slippage on cross-stablecoin swaps
- Access to deep liquidity across all pairs

### For Market Makers
- Single liquidity pool to manage
- More efficient capital deployment
- Reduced complexity compared to managing multiple pairs

### For the Protocol
- Lower on-chain state requirements
- Simplified order book management
- Better scaling as new stablecoins are added

## Integration with Stablecoin Exchange

LinkingUSD integrates seamlessly with the [Stablecoin Exchange](/protocol/stablecoin-exchange/stablecoin-exchange):
- All USD stablecoins can trade through linkingUSD
- Orders automatically route through optimal paths
- End-of-block settlement prevents MEV

## Usage Restrictions

:::info
LinkingUSD cannot be used directly for fee payment. Users must swap to a regular stablecoin for gas fees.
