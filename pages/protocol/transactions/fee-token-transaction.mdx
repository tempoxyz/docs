:::

## Overview

FeeTokenTransaction (Type 0x77) was an EIP-2718 transaction type that extended EIP-1559/EIP-7702 semantics to support:

- Optional fee token preferences at the transaction level
- Third-party fee payment via additional signatures
- EIP-7702 authorization lists for delegation
- Backwards compatibility with standard transaction types

## Key Features

### Fee Token Selection
Transactions could specify a preferred fee token, overriding account, contract, or validator-level preferences.

### Fee Sponsorship
Supported sponsored fee payments through an additional `fee_payer_signature` field, allowing third parties to pay transaction fees without account abstraction indirection.

### EIP-7702 Compatibility
Preserved full EIP-7702 capabilities including authorization lists and delegated code execution.

## Migration

Applications using FeeTokenTransaction should migrate to [AATransaction (Type 0x76)](/protocol/transactions/aa-transaction), which provides:
- Native account abstraction support
- WebAuthn/P256 signature validation for passkeys
- Parallelizable nonces for higher throughput
- Call batching and scheduled transactions
- Improved gas sponsorship mechanisms
