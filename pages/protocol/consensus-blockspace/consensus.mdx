# Consensus

## Overview

Tempo uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to validate transactions and produce blocks. The consensus layer coordinates validators, manages block production, and ensures network security.

## Key Features

### Proof of Stake
- Validators stake tokens to participate in consensus
- Economic incentives align validator behavior with network security
- Slashing for provable misbehavior

### Block Production
- Regular block times for predictable transaction finality
- Validator rotation for decentralization
- Integration with blockspace management (payment lanes, sub-blocks)

### Finality
- Fast finality for user transactions
- Economic finality through stake weight
- Compatible with Ethereum finality gadgets

## Protocol Integration

The consensus layer integrates with core protocol features:

### Fee Token Validation
- Validators specify preferred fee tokens via `block.coinbase`
- Validate fee token liquidity requirements
- Coordinate with Fee AMM for token conversion

### Blockspace Management
- Support for [payment lanes](/protocol/consensus-blockspace/payment-lanes)
- Organization of transactions into [sub-blocks](/protocol/consensus-blockspace/subblocks)
- Priority ordering for transaction inclusion

### Reward Distribution
- Block rewards distributed to validators
- Integration with TIP-20 reward mechanisms
- Validator commission on delegated stake

## Validator Responsibilities

Validators perform several critical functions:

1. **Block Proposal**: Create and propose new blocks containing valid transactions
2. **Block Validation**: Verify proposed blocks meet consensus rules
3. **State Transitions**: Execute transactions and update state
4. **Network Security**: Maintain uptime and honest behavior
