# Block Format

## Overview

This specification defines the structure and encoding of blocks in the Tempo blockchain.

## Abstract

Tempo blocks extend the Ethereum block format with additional fields and structures to support protocol features including payment lanes, sub-blocks, and multi-token fee payment.

## Motivation

The block format must accommodate:
- Payment lane organization for transaction ordering
- Sub-block structure for parallel execution
- Fee token metadata for validator preferences
- Backwards compatibility with Ethereum tooling

## Specification

:::note Work in Progress
This specification is currently being developed. Check back for detailed block structure, encoding rules, and validation requirements.

### Block Header

The block header includes standard Ethereum fields plus Tempo-specific extensions:

```
TODO: Define block header structure
```

### Block Body

The block body organizes transactions according to:
- Payment lane assignments
- Sub-block boundaries
- Fee token preferences

```
TODO: Define block body structure
```

### Encoding

```
TODO: Define RLP encoding rules
```

## Validation Rules

```
TODO: Define block validation rules
```
