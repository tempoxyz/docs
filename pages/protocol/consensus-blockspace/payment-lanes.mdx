# Payment Lanes

## Overview

Payment Lanes provide a transaction ordering system that enables parallel processing and priority-based inclusion. Transactions are assigned to different lanes based on their characteristics, allowing validators to optimize block construction.

## Purpose

Payment lanes solve several challenges in blockchain transaction processing:

### Parallel Execution
- Transactions in different lanes can execute in parallel
- Reduces block production time
- Improves overall throughput

### Priority Management
- Different lanes can have different inclusion priorities
- Enables market-based transaction ordering
- Allows fee market segmentation

### MEV Mitigation
- Separate lanes for different transaction types
- Reduces opportunities for harmful MEV extraction
- Protects user transactions from sandwich attacks

## Lane Types

Tempo implements multiple payment lanes with distinct characteristics:

### User Transaction Lane
- Standard user-initiated transactions
- Regular priority based on fees
- Default lane for most activity

### High-Priority Lane
- Transactions requiring immediate inclusion
- Higher fee requirements
- Guaranteed ordering properties

### Protocol Lane
- System-level transactions
- End-of-block settlements
- Fee AMM operations

## Lane Assignment

Transactions are assigned to lanes based on:
- Transaction type (AATransaction, FeeTokenTransaction, etc.)
- Fee parameters and priorities
- Sender characteristics or preferences
- Protocol requirements

## Integration with Protocol

### Fee System
Payment lanes integrate with the [fee system](/protocol/fees/fees):
- Lane assignment affects fee calculation
- Different lanes may have different fee markets
- Validators optimize across lanes

### Sub-blocks
Lanes work with [sub-blocks](/protocol/consensus-blockspace/subblocks):
- Each lane produces sub-blocks
- Sub-blocks enable parallel execution
- Ordering preserved within lanes

### Consensus
Lane structure affects [consensus](/protocol/consensus-blockspace/consensus):
- Validators must respect lane ordering
- Block validity depends on correct lane assignment
- Finality applies per-lane

## Developer Considerations

When building on Tempo, consider:
- Which lane suits your transaction type
- Trade-offs between cost and inclusion speed
- Impact of lane choice on execution timing
