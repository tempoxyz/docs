# Motivation [Why payments need their own chain]

## History

In the sixteen years since the Bitcoin genesis block, blockchains have proved they can be used to secure and help users move digital assets at internet scale. 

What blockchains have not done so well thus far is more mundane but mission-critical to the global economy: payments. A majority of the planet's payment flows use rails that were invented from decades to centuries ago. Today, payments have high fees, long settlement times, and high failure rates. 

To date, blockchains have not solved these problems, despite the tremendous potential demonstrated by stablecoins, in part because the general-purpose blockchains that gave rise to stablecoins were not optimized to handle payments.

## Tempo

Tempo is built for payments. Rather than starting from generalized compute and retrofitting payments, Tempo starts from payments and will build everything else around them. The goal is to move money reliably, cheaply, and at scale. 

Tempo's north star is simplicity for users: fintechs, traditional banks, merchants, platforms, or anyone else looking to move their payments into the 21st century. The base layer will be permissionless, so anyone can connect and build, while asset issuers retain fine-grained control over the rules their assets must follow. Where today's chains require fee tokens and bespoke contract logic, Tempo lets participants pay fees in the same stablecoins they already hold and exposes common payment workflows at the protocol level so that apps can interoperate out of the box.

The Tempo protocol is designed to optimize for payment use-cases by making specific trade-offs across the entire stack. This necessitates a dedicated blockchain rather than building on existing general-purpose blockchains. For instance, Tempo features optimized implementations core payment functionality, e.g., transfers, stablecoin AMMs, privacy, and multisigs. Implementing such optimizations requires a dedicated blockchain. Further, Tempo has changes to consensus mechanisms and gas accounting, along with blockspace allocation, all tailored for payments. Finally, some features, such as scheduled transactions, are simply not compatible with existing protocols.

## Principles

Tempo is guided by a set of core principles that shape its architecture and user experience.

**[Stablecoin Neutrality](/litepaper/neutrality)** is foundational to Tempo's design. We envision a future where many stablecoins coexist, each serving different needs and communities. Tempo is built as a level playing field, ensuring that no single stablecoin is privileged by the protocol itself. This neutrality encourages competition, innovation, and broad participation from issuers and users alike.

**Predictable Fees** are another key principle, and also an instantiation of the Neutrality principle. On Tempo, users can pay transaction fees in any stablecoin they already hold, eliminating the need to acquire or manage a volatile native gas token. This approach simplifies the user experience and makes payments more accessible and intuitive, especially for those new to blockchain technology.

Tempo is **[Designed for Payments](/litepaper/payments)** from the ground up. Features that are essential for real-world payment flows—such as memos, payment references, and batch transactions are built directly into the protocol. This avoids the need for ad-hoc or third-party solutions, ensuring that payment workflows are robust, interoperable, and easy to use for developers and end users.

The protocol also balances a **Permissionless Base** with **Issuer Control**. Anyone can use the chain, fostering openness and innovation. At the same time, asset issuers retain the ability to define and enforce compliance and policy rules for their own tokens, allowing them to meet regulatory obligations without compromising the permissionless nature of the network.

**Opt-in, Compliant [Privacy](/litepaper/privacy)** is a further principle. Tempo aims to support fully-private balances and transactions at scale, but always on an opt-in basis. This privacy is designed to coexist with the needs of issuers to comply with reporting and regulatory requirements, ensuring that privacy and compliance are not mutually exclusive.

Finally, **High [Performance](/litepaper/performance)** is engineered into every layer of Tempo. The protocol is optimized for throughput and low-latency confirmations, with dedicated infrastructure—such as a transfer lane—ensuring that pure value transfers remain fast and predictable, even when the network is under heavy load.

Together, these principles ensure that Tempo is not just another blockchain, but a purpose-built platform for payments that addresses the real needs of users, issuers, and developers.
