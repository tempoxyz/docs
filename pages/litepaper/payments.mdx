# Optimized for payments

Tempo extends the ERC-20 token standard into the fully backward-compatible [TIP-20](/protocol/tokens/tip-20) standard to include features that make implementing payment flows easier for developers. 

## Memo fields in payments

Transfers in the real world include structured context, e.g., invoice numbers, customer IDs, cost centers, ISO 20022-style fields, or simple human-readable notes. The TIP-20 standard enables a new native TransferWithMemo functionality so that a transfer can link to a memo for backend reconciliation. To accommodate larger memos and control costs, Tempo provides flexible avenues to store and communicate the full memo while only relevant commitment to the memo (i.e., a hash, a locator, etc.) travels with the actual transfer. 

## Policies and compliance (asset-level controls)

As we suggested in the previous section, we expect there to be many stablecoins. In many cases, these stables will share an issuer and/or compliance policy. The Tempo token standard enables providers to expose policies, for instance, allowlists or blocklists via the [TIP-403](/protocol/tokens/tip-403) standard. Individual TIP-20 tokens can then adopt their desired policies. 

A compliance manager at an issuer needs to update only a single policy, and this will be followed by all tokens adopting the policy. 

## Token implementation and standardized interface

On Tempo all stablecoins or deposit tokens behave in a uniform way. TIP-20 defines a canonical interface for stablecoins so that there is standardization across stables that represent the same underlying currency. All TIP-20 tokens use 6 decimals, and tokens declare an arbitrary `currency` string (e.g., "USD"). 

Currently, fee payments, the FeeAMM, and the stablecoin exchange only support USD tokens.

Beyond our TIP-20 contract suite, we also have several other payments-focused features built in to the protocol.

## Dedicated Transfer Lanes

Tempo includes a dedicated transfer lane that ensures that even if the chain is busy with other activity, payment users have reliable, guaranteed throughput at predictable prices.  Transactions that only affect simple transfers have a dedicated lane in Tempo: formally, we reserve a portion of the blockspace for such transfers. For more details, see the [Payments Lane](/protocol/transactions/payments-lane) page.

## Smart Payment Accounts

Tempo's account model is designed from the ground up for high-volume, programmatic flows: 

* **High-throughput addresses.** Address behavior is designed so that many transfers can be processed concurrently from the same orchestrator, fixing a limitation in the classic EVM and unlocking streaming and real-time payments use cases.   
* **Batched transactions.** Orchestrators can submit thousands of payouts, captures, or refunds as a single batched operation. This reduces overhead and makes "one API call to pay a thousand people" practical.  
* **Sponsored transactions.** An account can sign a transaction and the gas fee can be paid by a different sponsor, allowing platforms to pay gas fees for their users.
