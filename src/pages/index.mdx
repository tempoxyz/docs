# Tempo [Documentation, integration guides, and protocol specifications]

## Welcome to Tempo! 

Tempo is a general-purpose blockchain optimized for payments. Tempo is designed to be a low-cost, high-throughput blockchain with user and developer features that we believe should be core to a modern payment system.

Tempo was designed in close collaboration with an exceptional group of [design partners](https://tempo.xyz/ecosystem) who are helping to validate the system against real payment workloads.

Whether you're new to stablecoins, ready to start building, or looking for partners to help you integrate, these docs will help you get started with Tempo.

## Testnet Migration

We've launched a new testnet to better align with our mainnet release candidate and provide faster feature release cycles. The old testnet has been deprecated.

**What you need to do:**

1. **Update your RPC URL** to `https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz`
2. **Update your chain ID** to `42431`
3. **Redeploy any contracts** to the new testnet
4. **Reset any databases or indexers** that depend on old testnet data

See [Connection Details](/quickstart/connection-details#direct-connection-details) for the full configuration.
