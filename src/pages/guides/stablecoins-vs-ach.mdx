# Stablecoins vs ACH Payments

ACH (Automated Clearing House) is the backbone of US domestic payments, processing billions of transactions annually. Stablecoins on Tempo offer a different approach to moving money. This guide compares both for various payment scenarios.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | ACH Standard | ACH Same Day | Tempo Stablecoins |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Transaction fee | $0.26-0.50 median | $0.26-0.50 + premium | ~$0.001 |
| Settlement time | 1-2 business days | Same business day (hours) | ~0.5 seconds |
| Availability | Banking days only | Banking days only | 24/7/365 |
| Transaction limit | Up to $1M+ | Up to $1M (varies by bank) | No protocol limit |
| Receiver requirements | US bank account | US bank account | Crypto wallet |
| Reversibility | Can be reversed | Can be reversed | Final |

## ACH Strengths

### Universal Bank Acceptance

Nearly every US bank account can send and receive ACH payments. No special setup, wallets, or onboarding required—just routing and account numbers.

### Established Legal Framework

ACH operates under NACHA rules with clear dispute resolution, error correction, and consumer protection. Regulations like Reg E protect consumers from unauthorized transactions.

### Ideal for Recurring Payments

ACH excels at recurring domestic payments: payroll, subscriptions, utility bills. The batch processing model works well for predictable, scheduled transfers.

### Low Cost for Domestic Volume

At $0.26-0.50 per transaction, ACH is cost-effective for domestic payments, especially compared to wire transfers or card processing.

### Familiar and Trusted

Businesses and consumers understand ACH. Accounting systems, ERPs, and payroll software have built-in ACH support.

## Stablecoin Strengths on Tempo

### True Instant Settlement

Transactions finalize in ~0.5 seconds, 24/7. No waiting for batch processing windows or next business day. Payment received = payment settled.

### Sub-Cent Fees

At ~$0.001 per transaction, fees are negligible even for micropayments. Send $1 or $1 million for the same cost.

### No Banking Day Restrictions

Weekends, holidays, 3 AM—payments work identically. Critical for global operations or time-sensitive transfers.

### Global by Default

Same system works for domestic and international payments. No correspondent banks or cross-border complexity.

### Final Settlement

Transactions cannot be reversed after confirmation. Reduces fraud risk for merchants and eliminates chargeback concerns.

## Detailed Fee Comparison

| Payment Amount | ACH Cost | Tempo Cost | Savings |
|----------------|----------|------------|---------|
| $10 | $0.26-0.50 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $100 | $0.26-0.50 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $1,000 | $0.26-0.50 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $10,000 | $0.26-0.50 | $0.001 | 99%+ |

*Note: ACH fees vary by provider. Some charge percentage fees instead of flat rates.*

## Settlement Time Comparison

| Scenario | ACH | Tempo |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Friday 5 PM payment | Tuesday delivery | Instant |
| Holiday weekend | Next business day | Instant |
| Urgent payment | Same Day ACH (hours, premium fee) | Instant |
| International | Not supported | Instant |

## Use Cases: When to Use Each

### Choose ACH When

- **Domestic US payments**: Paying US vendors, employees, or customers with bank accounts
- **Recurring payments**: Payroll, rent, subscriptions where timing is predictable
- **Traditional business integration**: Partners expect/require ACH
- **Consumer payments**: Customers prefer paying from bank accounts
- **Regulatory requirements**: Compliance mandates bank-based payments

### Choose Tempo When

- **Speed matters**: Real-time settlement required
- **High volume, low value**: Micropayments, API billing, streaming payments
- **24/7 operations**: Payments needed outside banking hours
- **International payments**: Same system for domestic and global
- **Cost optimization**: High transaction volumes where fees add up
- **Programmable payments**: Smart contract automation, conditional logic

## Example: Payroll Comparison

**100 employees, bi-weekly payroll:**

| Method | Per-Transaction Fee | Total Monthly Cost | Settlement |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| ACH | $0.50 | $200 | 1-2 days |
| Tempo | $0.001 | $0.40 | Instant |

*Savings: $199.60/month ($2,395/year)*

## Hybrid Approach

Many businesses use both:

1. **ACH for**: Employee payroll (where employees prefer bank deposits), vendor payments to traditional businesses, customer recurring billing
2. **Tempo for**: International contractor payments, real-time settlements, high-frequency micropayments, after-hours urgent transfers

## Limitations to Consider

### ACH Limitations
- Banking hours only
- 1-2 day standard settlement
- US domestic only
- Reversible (fraud risk for merchants)
- Batch processing delays

### Tempo Limitations
- Requires crypto wallet
- Less familiar to traditional businesses
- Stablecoin on/off ramps needed
- Newer technology with evolving ecosystem
- No built-in dispute resolution

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo stablecoins are the better choice if you:

- Need payments to settle in seconds, not days
- Operate 24/7 or across time zones
- Process high volumes where sub-cent fees matter
- Want to avoid banking hour restrictions
- Need the same system for domestic and international

ACH remains the right choice for traditional US domestic payments where recipients expect bank deposits and timing is flexible.
