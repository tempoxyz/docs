# ACH Alternatives

ACH (Automated Clearing House) processes over 30 billion transactions annually in the US, making it the backbone of domestic payments. But its 1-2 day settlement times don't work for every use case. This guide compares alternatives when you need faster, cheaper, or more flexible payment options.

## Comparison Table

| Alternative | Speed | Cost | Availability | Best For |
|-------------|-------|------|--------------|----------|
| Same-Day ACH | Same business day | $0.50-1.50 | Banking hours | Urgent domestic, same infrastructure |
| Wire Transfers | Same day domestic | $25-50 | Banking hours | Large, time-sensitive payments |
| RTP (Real-Time Payments) | Seconds | $0.01-1.00 | 24/7 | Real-time domestic up to $1M |
| FedNow | Seconds | $0.01-0.50 | 24/7 | Real-time via Federal Reserve |
| Stablecoins (Tempo) | ~0.5 seconds | ~$0.001 | 24/7/365 | Global, programmable, any amount |
| PayPal/Venmo | Instant to balance | 1.75-2.9% | 24/7 | Consumer payments, social payments |
| Zelle | Minutes | Free (bank-subsidized) | 24/7 | Person-to-person, bank customers |

## When ACH Is the Right Choice

Before exploring alternatives, recognize what ACH does well:

- **Recurring payments**: Payroll, subscriptions, rent—predictable timing works perfectly
- **Low cost**: $0.26-0.50 per transaction is hard to beat for domestic volume
- **Universal acceptance**: Every US bank account can receive ACH
- **Established processes**: Accounting systems, ERPs, and compliance frameworks built around ACH

If your payments are domestic, recurring, and timing-flexible, ACH remains excellent.

## Same-Day ACH

### How It Works

Same-Day ACH uses the existing ACH network with additional processing windows. Payments submitted by cutoff times settle the same business day.

### Speed & Cost

- **Settlement**: Same business day (multiple windows: 10:30 AM, 2:45 PM, 4:45 PM ET)
- **Cost**: Standard ACH fee + $0.50-1.00 Same-Day premium
- **Limit**: $1 million per transaction

### Best For

- Urgent payroll corrections
- Last-minute vendor payments
- Time-sensitive domestic transfers

### Limitations

- Banking hours only (no weekends/holidays)
- Premium fees add up at volume
- Still hours, not minutes

## Wire Transfers

### How It Works

Wires are direct bank-to-bank transfers processed through Fedwire (domestic) or SWIFT (international). Higher priority than ACH batch processing.

### Speed & Cost

- **Domestic**: Same day if submitted before cutoff (typically 3-5 PM local)
- **International**: 1-5 business days via correspondent banks
- **Cost**: $25-50 domestic, $40-80 international (plus correspondent fees)

### Best For

- Large, time-sensitive payments
- Real estate closings
- M&A transactions
- Situations requiring bank-based audit trails

### Limitations

- High fees make wires impractical for regular payments
- Banking hours only
- International transfers still take days

## RTP (Real-Time Payments)

### How It Works

The RTP network, operated by The Clearing House, enables instant payments between participating banks. Launched in 2017 and growing in adoption.

### Speed & Cost

- **Settlement**: Seconds, 24/7/365
- **Cost**: $0.01-1.00 per transaction (varies by bank)
- **Limit**: $1 million per transaction

### Best For

- Real-time B2B payments
- Urgent disbursements
- Just-in-time payments
- Payroll for gig workers

### Limitations

- Not all banks participate (~65% of US accounts reachable)
- Primarily US domestic
- Bank integration required
- Request for Payment feature adoption still growing

## FedNow

### How It Works

The Federal Reserve's instant payment service launched in 2023. Similar to RTP but operated by the Fed rather than a private consortium.

### Speed & Cost

- **Settlement**: Seconds, 24/7/365
- **Cost**: $0.01-0.50 per transaction (Fed pricing + bank markup)
- **Limit**: $500,000 per transaction (default), configurable

### Best For

- Real-time payments through community banks
- Government disbursements
- Credit unions and smaller institutions

### Limitations

- Newer system, still building bank adoption
- US domestic only
- Some banks implementing slowly
- Lower default limits than RTP

## Stablecoins on Tempo

### How It Works

Stablecoins like USDC represent dollars on blockchain networks. Tempo is a blockchain purpose-built for payments with instant finality and sub-cent fees.

### Speed & Cost

- **Settlement**: ~0.5 seconds to finality
- **Cost**: ~$0.001 per transaction
- **Limit**: No protocol limit

### Best For

- Global payments (same system domestic and international)
- Programmable payments (smart contract automation)
- High-frequency, low-value transactions
- 24/7 operations
- Cost-sensitive high-volume payments

### How Tempo Compares to Other ACH Alternatives

| Feature | RTP/FedNow | Stablecoins (Tempo) |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| Speed | Seconds | ~0.5 seconds |
| Geographic reach | US only | Global |
| Cost | $0.01-1.00 | ~$0.001 |
| Bank required | Yes | No (wallet-based) |
| Programmability | Limited | Smart contracts |
| Hours | 24/7 | 24/7 |

### Limitations

- Requires crypto wallet (not bank account)
- On/off ramps needed for fiat conversion
- Less familiar to traditional businesses
- Evolving regulatory landscape

## PayPal and Venmo

### How It Works

PayPal and Venmo maintain internal ledgers for instant transfers between users. Funds can be held in balance or transferred to bank accounts.

### Speed & Cost

- **Between users**: Instant (within platform)
- **To bank**: 1-3 days free, or instant for 1.75%
- **Receiving payments**: 2.9% + $0.30 for business transactions

### Best For

- E-commerce checkout
- Social payments (splitting bills)
- Small business point-of-sale

### Limitations

- High fees for business transactions
- Account freezes and holds
- Withdrawal delays
- Not ideal for B2B or high-value transfers

## Zelle

### How It Works

Zelle enables instant transfers between bank accounts at participating institutions. Integrated directly into banking apps.

### Speed & Cost

- **Settlement**: Minutes (typically instant)
- **Cost**: Free for consumers (bank-subsidized)
- **Limit**: $500-5,000/day depending on bank

### Best For

- Person-to-person payments
- Rent payments
- Small business payments from consumers

- Must be enrolled through participating bank
- No dispute protection for authorized payments

## Choosing the Right Alternative

| Your Need | Best Alternative |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Urgent domestic, keep existing process | Same-Day ACH |
| Large, bank-documented payment | Wire Transfer |
| Real-time domestic B2B | RTP or FedNow |
| Global, any time, any amount | Stablecoins (Tempo) |
| Consumer checkout | PayPal |
| Person-to-person | Zelle |

## Cost Comparison: 100 Monthly Payments

| Method | Per-Transaction | Monthly Total |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Standard ACH | $0.40 | $40 |
| Same-Day ACH | $1.00 | $100 |
| Wire Transfer | $35 | $3,500 |
| RTP | $0.50 | $50 |
| FedNow | $0.25 | $25 |
| Tempo | $0.001 | $0.10 |

## The Future: Multiple Rails

Most businesses will use multiple payment rails strategically:

- **ACH**: Recurring domestic payments where timing is flexible
- **RTP/FedNow**: Urgent domestic payments
- **Stablecoins**: International, after-hours, and programmable payments
- **Wires**: Large transactions requiring bank documentation

The key is matching payment method to use case rather than forcing all payments through one system.
