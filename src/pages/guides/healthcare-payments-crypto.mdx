# Healthcare Payments with Crypto

Healthcare payments across borders face significant friction. International patients, medical tourism, and cross-border insurance claims involve wire fees, currency conversion, and processing delays. Stablecoin payments on Tempo simplify international healthcare transactions.

## The Healthcare Payment Problem

| Payment Scenario | Traditional Cost | Traditional Time |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| International patient wire | $40-75 | 3-5 days |
| Currency conversion | 2-4% markup | Immediate |
| Cross-border insurance claim | Processing fees + delays | 30-90 days |
| Medical tourism deposit | $50 wire + FX | 3-5 days |
| **Tempo transfer** | **~$0.001** | **Instant** |

For a $25,000 medical procedure paid by an international patient:

| Cost Component | Traditional | Tempo |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Wire transfer fee | $50 | ~$0.001 |
| Currency conversion (3%) | $750 | $0* |
| **Total fees** | **$800** | **~$0.001** |

*Parties transact directly in stablecoins

## Benefits for Healthcare

### Medical Tourism Payments

International patients pay deposits and final bills without wire delays or currency conversion losses. Funds arrive instantly regardless of patient location.

### Cross-Border Insurance Claims

Insurers and providers settle claims directly without correspondent banking delays. Reduce days-sales-outstanding for international claims.

### Reduced Administrative Costs

Eliminate manual wire tracking, failed payment follow-up, and currency reconciliation overhead.

### Instant Payment Confirmation

Confirm patient payment immediately. No waiting for wire verification before scheduling procedures.

### Global Patient Access

Accept payments from patients worldwide. Remove payment friction that prevents international patients from accessing care.

## How It Works

### Patient Payment Flow

1. Provider generates invoice with stablecoin payment option
2. Patient receives payment instructions with procedure metadata
3. Patient sends stablecoins from their wallet
4. Provider receives instant confirmation
5. Procedure scheduled or services rendered

### Payment Metadata

Attach clinical and billing context to transactions:

- Patient ID
- Invoice or claim number
- Procedure codes
- Provider identifiers
- Insurance reference (if applicable)
- Payment type (deposit, copay, full payment, balance)

### Insurance Claim Settlement

For cross-border insurance payments:

1. Provider submits claim to insurer
2. Insurer approves and initiates stablecoin payment
3. Provider receives instant settlement
4. Transaction metadata links to original claim

## Implementation

### For Healthcare Providers

1. Set up payment wallet with appropriate security controls
2. Integrate payment option into patient billing system
3. Generate unique payment references per invoice
4. Monitor incoming payments via webhook
5. Auto-reconcile with billing system using metadata

### For Medical Tourism Facilitators

1. Collect patient wallet addresses during booking
2. Send deposit requests with procedure details
3. Confirm deposits instantly before provider booking
4. Coordinate final payment before patient travel

### For Insurers

1. Configure claims payment system for stablecoin disbursement
2. Batch provider payments with claim metadata
3. Reduce international payment costs and delays
4. Maintain audit trail for regulatory compliance

## Use Cases

### Medical Tourism

Patients traveling for procedures pay deposits and final bills without international wire complexity. Providers confirm payment before patient arrival.

### International Insurance

Global insurers settle claims with providers across multiple countries in a single batch, reducing per-payment costs from $50+ to ~$0.001.

### Expatriate Healthcare

Expats accessing care in their country of residence pay without routing through home country banks.

### Telemedicine

International telemedicine consultations collect payment instantly without cross-border card processing fees.

### Clinical Trial Payments

Research organizations compensate international trial participants without wire overhead.

## Compliance Considerations

- **HIPAA**: Transaction metadata should not include protected health information in public fields
- **Patient Records**: Link transaction hashes to internal billing records for audit trail
- **Insurance Regulations**: Maintain documentation per jurisdiction requirements
- **AML/KYC**: Implement appropriate patient verification for large transactions
