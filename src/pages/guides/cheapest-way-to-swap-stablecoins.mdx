# Cheapest Way to Swap Stablecoins

Swap between stablecoins for less than a tenth of a cent on Tempo's native stablecoin DEX.

## Why Stablecoin Swaps Are Usually Expensive

On most blockchains, swapping stablecoins means:
- High gas fees ($1-50+ on Ethereum mainnet)
- DEX trading fees (0.01-0.3%)
- Slippage on large orders
- MEV extraction by bots

Tempo eliminates these costs with a purpose-built stablecoin exchange.

## Tempo's Stablecoin DEX

Tempo includes a native decentralized exchange optimized specifically for stablecoin trading:

- **Sub-cent transaction fees**: Fixed, predictable cost regardless of swap size
- **Stablecoin gas**: Pay fees in stablecoins—no need for a separate gas token
- **Consolidated liquidity**: All stablecoin liquidity in one protocol-level pool
- **No MEV**: Dedicated payment lanes prevent sandwich attacks

## How to Swap

1. Connect your wallet to Tempo
2. Select your source stablecoin
3. Select your destination stablecoin
4. Enter your amount
5. Confirm the swap—settled in ~0.5 seconds

## Available Stablecoins

Tempo currently supports native USD stablecoins for swapping:

- USDC (Circle)
- USDT (Tether)

Additional stablecoins including EURC, DAI, and PYUSD are coming soon.
