## PayPal Strengths

### Massive Consumer Reach

### Buyer Protection

### Seller Protection

Protection against unauthorized transactions and fraudulent chargebacks (with conditions). Established dispute resolution process.

### Free Domestic P2P

Sending money to friends and family in the US is free when funded from PayPal balance or bank account.

### No Crypto Knowledge Required

Works with email addresses and phone numbers. No wallets, private keys, or blockchain understanding needed.

### Integrated Checkout

### Consumer Trust

Established brand with customer support. Non-technical users feel comfortable.

## Tempo Strengths

### Dramatically Lower Fees

| $100 (international) | $5+ | $0.001 |

PayPal can freeze accounts and hold funds. Tempo wallets are self-custodial—you control your money.

### 24/7 Global Operation

## Use Cases: When to Use Each

### Choose PayPal When

- **Consumer e-commerce**: Buyers expect PayPal and want buyer protection
- **Unknown counterparties**: Dispute resolution matters for trust
- **Free P2P**: Domestic friend/family payments (bank-funded)
- **Business tools needed**: Invoicing, reporting, accounting integrations
- **Non-crypto users**: Recipients don't have or want wallets
- **Checkout conversion**: One-click purchasing reduces cart abandonment

### Choose Tempo When

- **Business-to-business**: Known counterparties where chargebacks aren't needed
- **International payments**: Avoid 5%+ fees and FX spreads
- **High-volume operations**: Percentage fees become massive at scale
- **Merchant cost savings**: Eliminate 2.9%+ processing fees
- **Crypto-native recipients**: Both parties comfortable with wallets
- **Programmable payments**: Automated, conditional, streaming
- **Chargeback-free**: Digital goods, services, or trusted relationships

## Example: SaaS Business

**$100,000 monthly revenue, 2,000 transactions averaging $50:**

| Method | Processing Cost | Monthly Savings |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| PayPal (2.9% + $0.30) | $3,500 | — |
| Tempo | $2 | $3,498 |

*Annual savings: ~$42,000*

But consider: Would customers pay with stablecoins? Do you need buyer protection for conversions?

## The Buyer Protection Tradeoff

PayPal's buyer protection:
- Drives consumer trust and conversion
- Protects against fraud and non-delivery
- Enables purchases from unknown merchants
- Creates chargeback risk for sellers

Tempo's finality:
- Eliminates chargeback fraud (friendly fraud costs merchants $100B+ annually)
- Guarantees payment certainty
- Better for B2B and known relationships
- No protection if things go wrong

Choose based on your customer relationships and use case.

## Hybrid Approach

Many businesses accept both:

1. **PayPal for**: Consumer checkout, buyers wanting protection, users without crypto
2. **Tempo for**: B2B payments, crypto-native customers, international suppliers, high-value transactions

Offer stablecoin payment as a discount option (pass fee savings to customers).

## Limitations to Consider

### PayPal Limitations
- High fees (2.9%+ cards, 5%+ international)
- Poor FX rates (3-4% spread)
- Account freezes and holds possible
- Chargeback risk for merchants
- 1-3 day bank withdrawal
- Limited programmability

### Tempo Limitations
- No buyer protection
- No dispute resolution
- Requires crypto wallets
- Less consumer familiarity
- No integrated checkout (yet)
- On/off ramp needed for fiat

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo is the better choice if you:

- Process B2B payments where buyer protection isn't needed
- Make international payments and want to avoid FX spreads
- Run high-volume operations where percentage fees compound
- Need programmable payment logic
- Want to eliminate chargeback risk
- Have crypto-comfortable counterparties

PayPal remains excellent for consumer e-commerce, buyer protection scenarios, and users who prefer traditional payment methods.
