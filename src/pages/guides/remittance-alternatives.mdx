# Remittance Alternatives

The global remittance market exceeds $700 billion annually, yet the average cost to send money internationally remains 5-8%. For migrant workers sending money home, these fees consume billions that could support families.

This guide compares all remittance alternatives—from traditional banks to informal channels to stablecoins—helping you find the cheapest, fastest way to send money to your specific corridor.

## Quick Comparison

| Method | Average Cost | Speed | Best For |
|--------|--------------|-------|----------|
| Banks (SWIFT) | 8-12% | 3-5 days | Large amounts, compliance |
| Western Union/MoneyGram | 5-10% | Minutes-days | Cash pickup, remote areas |
| Wise | 0.5-2% | Hours-days | Bank-to-bank, transparency |
| Remitly | 1-4% | Minutes-days | Common corridors, promotions |
| PayPal/Xoom | 3-5% | Minutes-days | PayPal users |
| Hawala/Informal | 1-5% | Same day | Trust-based, limited areas |
| Stablecoins | Under 0.1% | ~500ms | Digital-native recipients |

## The 5-8% Problem

According to the World Bank, the global average cost to send $200 is approximately 6.2%. That means:

- **$200 transfer** → Recipient gets ~$187
- **$500 transfer** → Recipient gets ~$469
- **$1,000 transfer** → Recipient gets ~$938

For families depending on remittances, that 6% pays rent, buys food, funds education. The UN Sustainable Development Goals target reducing remittance costs to 3%—we're not there yet.

### Where the Costs Hide

| Cost Component | Typical Range | Who Charges |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Transfer fee | $5-50 | Sender's provider |
| FX markup | 2-5% | Provider |
| Correspondent bank fees | $10-30 | Intermediary banks |
| Receiving bank fee | $5-20 | Recipient's bank |
| Agent commission | 1-3% | Cash pickup agent |

## Banks (SWIFT Transfers)

**Best for:** Large amounts, corporate compliance, existing banking relationships

Traditional bank wire transfers via SWIFT remain the default for many, despite being among the most expensive options.

### Pros

- **Regulatory clarity**: Banks are heavily regulated and compliant
- **High limits**: Can transfer very large amounts
- **Business integration**: Works with corporate treasury systems
- **Paper trail**: Traditional documentation for compliance

### Cons

- **Expensive**: $25-50 fee + 3-5% FX spread common
- **Slow**: 3-5 business days typical
- **Correspondent fees**: Hidden charges deducted en route

- **Minimum amounts**: Often not practical for small transfers

### True Cost Example: Bank Wire $500 USD → INR

| Cost Component | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| Wire fee | $35 |
| FX markup (3%) | $15 |
| Correspondent fee | $15 |
| Total cost | $65 (13%) |
| Recipient gets | ~$435 |

### When to Use Banks

## Western Union / MoneyGram

## Hawala / Informal Channels

**Best for:** Established trust networks, certain corridors

Hawala and other informal value transfer systems (IVTS) operate on trust networks, offering competitive rates but with significant risks and legal concerns.

### How It Works

1. Sender gives money to local hawala broker
2. Broker contacts partner in destination country
3. Partner pays recipient from local funds
4. Brokers settle later through trade, reverse transfers, etc.

### Pros

- **Low fees**: Often 1-3% total
- **Fast**: Same-day common
- **No bank needed**: Cash-to-cash
- **Reaches underserved areas**: Works where formal channels don't

### Cons

- **Illegal in many jurisdictions**: Regulatory risk
- **No recourse**: No dispute resolution if something goes wrong
- **Trust required**: Must know and trust the broker
- **No paper trail**: Problematic for taxes, compliance
- **Funds source questions**: May flag other financial activity

### When People Use Hawala

- Corridors with limited formal options
- Family/community trust networks
- Where formal channels are too expensive or slow

**Note**: We do not recommend hawala due to legal and counterparty risks. It's included here to acknowledge the reality of the remittance market.

## Stablecoins on Tempo

**Best for:** Digital-native senders and recipients, lowest fees, instant settlement

Stablecoins on Tempo offer a fundamentally different model: flat ~$0.001 fees regardless of amount, with instant global settlement. Tempo supports native USD stablecoins like pathUSD, AlphaUSD, BetaUSD, and ThetaUSD.

### Pros

- **Flat ~$0.001 fee**: 99%+ cheaper than traditional remittance
- **Instant**: ~500ms settlement, 24/7/365
- **No FX markup**: Send stablecoins, receive stablecoins
- **No intermediaries**: Direct wallet-to-wallet
- **Transparent**: Fees visible on-chain
- **No limits**: Protocol has no maximum

### Cons

- **Requires crypto wallets**: Learning curve for new users
- **Cash-out challenge**: Converting to local currency adds steps
- **Recipient must accept crypto**: Both parties need wallets
- **No dispute resolution**: Transactions are final
- **Adoption varies**: Some corridors have better crypto infrastructure

### Cost Comparison: Traditional vs Stablecoins

| Transfer Amount | Traditional (6%) | Stablecoins | Savings |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| $200 | $12 | $0.001 | $12 |
| $500 | $30 | $0.001 | $30 |
| $1,000 | $60 | $0.001 | $60 |
| $2,000 | $120 | $0.001 | $120 |

### The Cash-Out Question

The main challenge with stablecoins is converting to local currency:

1. **Crypto exchanges**: Binance, local exchanges in many countries
2. **P2P marketplaces**: LocalBitcoins-style platforms
3. **Merchants**: Increasing acceptance in some markets
4. **Keep as stablecoins**: Use for online purchases, hold value

Corridors with established crypto adoption (Nigeria, Philippines, Vietnam, Turkey) have easier cash-out.

### When to Use Stablecoins

- Recipient is comfortable with crypto wallets
- Corridor has reasonable crypto cash-out options
- Regular sender willing to help recipient set up
- Both parties want maximum value transfer

## The Future: Crypto Corridors

Stablecoin remittances are growing fastest in corridors where:

2. **Crypto-friendly regulations**: UAE, Singapore
3. **Strong crypto adoption**: Nigeria, Philippines, Vietnam
4. **Unstable local currencies**: Argentina, Turkey
5. **Underbanked populations**: Emerging markets

As crypto infrastructure matures, stablecoins may become the default for cost-conscious senders.
