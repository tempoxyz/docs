# Stablecoins vs Wise

Wise (formerly TransferWise) revolutionized international money transfers with transparent fees and real exchange rates. Stablecoins on Tempo offer a different approach. This guide compares both for cross-border payment use cases.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Wise | Tempo Stablecoins |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| Fee structure | From 0.57% (varies by corridor) | ~$0.001 flat |
| Speed | ~70% instant, rest 1-2 days | ~500ms always |
| FX spread | Near mid-market rate | None (stablecoin swaps) |
| Sender requirements | Bank account, KYC | Crypto wallet |
| Receiver requirements | Bank account | Crypto wallet |
| Coverage | 80+ countries | Global (wallet-to-wallet) |
| Regulatory status | Licensed money transmitter | Blockchain network |
| Maximum transfer | Varies by corridor | No protocol limit |

## Wise Strengths

## Stablecoin Strengths on Tempo

### Dramatically Lower Fees

~$0.001 flat fee regardless of amount. Wise charges percentage-based fees starting at 0.57%.

| Transfer Amount | Wise Fee (0.57-2%) | Tempo Fee | Savings |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| $100 | $0.57-2.00 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $1,000 | $5.70-20.00 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $10,000 | $57-200 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $100,000 | $570-2,000 | $0.001 | 99%+ |

*Wise fees vary by currency corridor. Some routes are more expensive.*

### Always Instant

~500ms to finality, every time. No "up to 2 business days" for certain corridors. Weekends and holidays work identically.

### No FX Spread on Stablecoins

Send stablecoins, receive stablecoins. Or swap between currencies at Tempo's native DEX rates. No currency conversion spread.

### No Transfer Limits

Protocol doesn't impose limits. Wise has corridor-specific maximums.

### 24/7 Operation

Works identically at 3 AM on Sunday as Tuesday at noon. No banking hours, no settlement delays.

### Programmable

Smart contracts enable automated payments, escrow, streaming payments, and conditional logic.

## Fee Comparison by Amount

| Amount | Wise (USD→EUR ~0.6%) | Tempo |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| $500 | $3.00 | $0.001 |
| $2,000 | $12.00 | $0.001 |
| $5,000 | $30.00 | $0.001 |
| $20,000 | $120.00 | $0.001 |
| $50,000 | $300.00 | $0.001 |

*Wise fees vary. USD→EUR is one of the cheapest corridors. Others like USD→INR can be 1-2%+.*

## Speed Comparison

| Scenario | Wise | Tempo |
|----------|------|-------|
| Best case | Instant (~seconds) | ~500ms |
| Typical | Minutes to hours | ~500ms |
| Worst case | 1-2 business days | ~500ms |
| Weekend | May delay | No impact |
| Holiday | May delay | No impact |

## Use Cases: When to Use Each

### Choose Wise When

- **Recipients need bank accounts**: Money must arrive in a traditional bank
- **No crypto infrastructure**: Neither party wants to manage wallets
- **Consumer familiarity**: Non-technical users prefer known brands
- **Regulatory requirements**: Need licensed money transmitter rails
- **Multi-currency accounts**: Want to hold EUR, GBP, etc. in local accounts
- **Customer support needed**: Dispute resolution, payment tracking

### Choose Tempo When

- **Both parties have wallets**: Sender and receiver comfortable with crypto
- **Cost optimization**: Large or frequent transfers where fees add up
- **Speed critical**: Must arrive in seconds, not hours
- **24/7 operations**: Payments outside banking hours
- **Programmable payments**: Automated, conditional, or streaming
- **No amount limits**: Large transfers without corridor restrictions

## Example: Freelancer Monthly Payments

**Paying 5 international contractors $2,000 each monthly:**

| Method | Per-Payment Fee | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Wise (~1% avg) | $20 | $100 | $1,200 |
| Tempo | $0.001 | $0.005 | $0.06 |

*Annual savings: ~$1,200*

## Hybrid Approach

Some businesses use both:

1. **Wise for**: Contractors who need bank deposits, one-time payments to new recipients, corridors where recipients lack crypto
2. **Tempo for**: Regular payments to crypto-comfortable recipients, large transfers, urgent payments, programmable payment logic

## Limitations to Consider

### Wise Limitations
- Percentage-based fees (expensive for large amounts)
- ~30% of transfers not instant
- Corridor-specific limits and delays
- Banking hours affect some routes
- KYC required for sender and receiver setup

### Tempo Limitations
- Requires crypto wallets (both parties)
- On/off ramp needed for fiat conversion
- Less consumer familiarity
- No built-in dispute resolution
- Recipients must be comfortable with crypto

## On/Off Ramp Consideration

Tempo is wallet-to-wallet. If recipients need fiat:

1. Receive stablecoins on Tempo
2. Use exchange or on-ramp service to convert to local currency
3. Withdraw to bank account

This adds a step but may still be cheaper for large amounts. The ecosystem for stablecoin-to-fiat is growing rapidly.

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo stablecoins are the better choice if you:

- Make regular international payments where both parties have wallets
- Transfer large amounts where percentage fees add up
- Need guaranteed instant settlement (not "usually instant")
- Operate 24/7 across time zones
- Want programmable payment logic

Wise remains excellent for transfers where recipients need traditional bank deposits or aren't comfortable with cryptocurrency.
