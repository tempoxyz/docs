# Send Money to Argentina with Crypto

Send money to Argentina using stablecoins on Tempo. Argentina leads Latin America in cryptocurrency adoption, driven by chronic peso volatility and inflation that has exceeded 100% annually. Stablecoins have become essential financial tools for millions of Argentines seeking dollar stability.

## The Argentina Corridor

Argentina receives significant remittances from the US and Europe. Traditional costs: wire transfers $40-60 with unfavorable official exchange rates, services 5-8%.

## Why Argentina Works

- Highest crypto adoption in Latin America — stablecoins account for 80%+ of trading volume
- Recipients can hold USDC directly as a hedge against peso inflation
- Multiple local fintech apps with instant peso conversion at market rates
- Crypto card options for spending directly without converting
- Avoids government-controlled exchange rates that penalize traditional remittances

## How It Works

1. Buy USDC through your preferred exchange
2. Send via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. Recipient holds USDC or converts to pesos at market rate
