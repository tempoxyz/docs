# Tempo vs Solana for Stablecoins

Solana offers high throughput and low fees, making it popular for stablecoin transfers. Tempo is purpose-built for stablecoin payments with native stablecoin gas. This guide compares both chains.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Solana | Tempo |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Transaction fee | $0.001-0.01 | ~$0.001 |
| Finality | ~0.4 seconds | ~0.5 seconds |
| Gas token | SOL | Stablecoins |
| Native USDC | Yes (Circle) | Yes |
| Native USDT | Yes | Yes |
| EVM compatible | No | Yes |
| Payment metadata | No | Yes |
| Stablecoin DEX | External (Jupiter, etc.) | Native |

## Solana Strengths

### High Throughput

Solana processes thousands of transactions per second with parallel execution. It handles high-volume applications including trading, gaming, and payments.

### Native USDC from Circle

Circle issues USDC natively on Solana via Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). This is first-class USDC, not a bridged token, with full Circle backing.

### Established DeFi Ecosystem

Jupiter, Raydium, and other protocols provide deep liquidity for swaps and trading. Solana's DeFi TVL ranks among the highest.

### Low Fees

Typical transactions cost $0.001-0.01, competitive with most L2s and significantly cheaper than Ethereum L1.

### Developer Adoption

Large developer community with extensive tooling, wallets, and infrastructure providers.

## Tempo Strengths

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Pay fees in stablecoins. Solana requires holding SOL for every transaction—exposing users to price volatility and requiring gas management.

### EVM Compatibility

Tempo supports Solidity smart contracts and Ethereum tooling (Hardhat, Foundry, ethers.js). Solana uses Rust and a different programming model, requiring specialized knowledge.

### Native Stablecoin DEX

Swap stablecoins at oracle prices with sub-cent fees. No external DEX, slippage, or MEV concerns.

### Payment Metadata

Attach invoice numbers, references, and custom data to transactions. Critical for business reconciliation and compliance.

### Predictable Availability

Tempo prioritizes consistent uptime. Solana has experienced network outages during high-demand periods, though reliability has improved.

## Use Cases: Where Each Excels

### Choose Solana When

- **Trading and DeFi**: Access Jupiter aggregator, perpetuals, and lending markets
- **NFTs and gaming**: Established ecosystem for collectibles and gaming assets
- **Existing Solana integration**: Your stack already uses Solana infrastructure
- **SOL holdings acceptable**: You're comfortable holding volatile tokens for gas

### Choose Tempo When

- **Pure stablecoin operations**: Send, receive, swap, and hold stablecoins
- **No volatile token exposure**: Keep 100% of funds in stable value
- **EVM tooling preferred**: Use Solidity, Hardhat, and Ethereum developer experience
- **Business payments**: Need metadata for invoices and reconciliation
- **Treasury simplicity**: Avoid managing SOL balances across accounts

## Cost Comparison

Both chains offer comparable fees for simple transfers:

| Operation | Solana | Tempo |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Send stablecoins | ~$0.001 | ~$0.001 |
| Swap stablecoins | $0.01-0.05 (DEX) | ~$0.001 (native) |
| Gas token required | SOL (~$5 buffer) | None |

The key difference: Solana users must acquire and manage SOL. Tempo users pay directly in stablecoins.

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo is the better choice if you:

- Want zero exposure to volatile tokens
- Prefer EVM compatibility and Ethereum tooling
- Need native payment metadata for business operations
- Want native stablecoin swaps without external DEX complexity
- Prioritize simplicity over DeFi composability

Solana remains strong for trading, gaming, NFTs, and users comfortable with its ecosystem and SOL management.
