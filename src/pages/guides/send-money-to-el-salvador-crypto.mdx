# Send Money to El Salvador with Crypto

Send money to El Salvador using stablecoins on Tempo. As the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador is uniquely ready for crypto remittances.

## The El Salvador Corridor

El Salvador receives billions in remittances annually, primarily from the United States. Remittances represent over 25% of GDP. Since 2021, Bitcoin has been legal tender alongside the US dollar, making crypto adoption mainstream.

Traditional remittance costs:
- Wire transfers: $25-40 per transaction
- Remittance services: 5-8% in fees
- Delivery: 1-3 days

## Why El Salvador Is Different

El Salvador's Bitcoin Law means:
- Crypto is legally accepted everywhere
- Government-backed Chivo wallet infrastructure
- High public awareness of digital assets
- No legal ambiguity around crypto transfers

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient uses** USDC directly or converts to USD cash

## Off-Ramp Options in El Salvador

Your recipient can use crypto through:
- Chivo ATMs (Bitcoin/cash conversion)
- Local exchanges and apps
- Direct spending at merchants
- P2P marketplaces
