# Built-in Stablecoin DEX

Tempo includes a native decentralized exchange optimized for stablecoin swaps, letting you convert between pathUSD, AlphaUSD, BetaUSD, ThetaUSD, and other stablecoins seamlessly.

## Why a Native DEX?

Different customers and vendors prefer different stablecoins. Rather than forcing everyone onto one standard, Tempo makes conversion frictionless.

## Features

- **Minimal slippage** — Optimized for stablecoin-to-stablecoin swaps
- **Deep liquidity** — Native integration ensures reliable execution
- **Low fees** — Swap costs are a fraction of a cent
- **Instant settlement** — Swaps finalize in ~0.5 seconds

## Supported Stablecoins

- pathUSD
- AlphaUSD
- BetaUSD
- ThetaUSD

Note: USDC and USDT are not currently available on Tempo.

## Use Cases

- **Accept any stablecoin** — Receive one stablecoin, convert to another automatically
- **Pay in preferred currency** — Convert to whatever your vendor accepts
- **Treasury management** — Rebalance stablecoin holdings easily
