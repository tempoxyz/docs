## Use Cases: When to Use Each

### Choose Venmo When

- **Casual US P2P**: Splitting bills, reimbursing friends, rent between roommates
- **Social payments**: Want the social feed, emojis, public confirmation
- **Free transfers**: Bank-funded P2P with no fees
- **Non-crypto users**: Friends don't have or want wallets
- **Venmo card spending**: Want to spend balance immediately
- **Small business**: Accept payments with buyer protection
- **Mainstream UX**: Simple, familiar interface

### Choose Tempo When

- **International transfers**: Venmo is US-only
- **Global recipients**: Pay anyone with a wallet worldwide
- **Card-funded efficiency**: Avoid 3% card fees
- **Fast bank access**: Don't want to pay 1.75% for instant transfer
- **Large amounts**: Exceed Venmo's weekly limits
- **Privacy**: No social feed or public transaction history
- **Crypto-native**: Recipients already comfortable with wallets
- **Business payments**: Higher volumes where fees matter

## Example: Roommate Rent

**4 roommates splitting $2,000 monthly rent:**

If everyone pays from bank account:
- Venmo: Free
- Tempo: $0.004 total

*Venmo is the obvious choice for casual US P2P*

## Example: Freelancer Receiving $3,000

**Client pays, freelancer needs money in bank:**

| Method | Fee to Receive | Fee to Bank | Total | Time to Bank |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Venmo | $0 | $0 (1-3 days) | $0 | 1-3 days |
| Venmo | $0 | $25 (instant) | $25 | Minutes |
| Tempo | $0.001 | Off-ramp varies | Varies | Varies |

## The Social Feature Difference

Venmo's social feed is polarizing:

**Why people like it:**
- Confirms payment was received
- Fun way to see friends' activity
- Social proof for businesses
- Emojis make payments playful

**Why people dislike it:**
- Privacy concerns
- Awkward transaction visibility
- Can reveal financial patterns

Tempo has no social features. Transactions are visible on a public blockchain but not tied to identity or social graph by default.

## Limitations to Consider

### Venmo Limitations
- US only
- 3% card-funded fee
- 1.75% instant transfer fee
- Weekly transfer limits
- Social feed (privacy concern)
- Account freezes possible
- No international transfers

### Tempo Limitations
- Requires crypto wallets
- No social features
- Less mainstream adoption
- On/off ramp friction
- No buyer/seller protection
- Recipients must understand crypto
- Not available for casual US P2P culture

## The Mainstream Reality

Venmo has network effects in the US. When splitting a restaurant bill, the question is "Does everyone have Venmo?" not "Does everyone have a crypto wallet?"

For mainstream US P2P payments, Venmo's free bank-funded transfers and ubiquity are hard to beat.

Tempo excels when:
- You need to go beyond US borders
- Card fees or instant transfer fees matter
- You're already in the crypto ecosystem
- Amount limits are a problem
- Privacy is important

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo is the better choice if you:

- Send money internationally (Venmo is US-only)
- Want to avoid 3% card fees or 1.75% instant transfer fees
- Transfer amounts exceeding Venmo limits
- Value privacy over social features
- Have crypto-comfortable recipients
- Need programmable payment logic

Venmo remains excellent for casual US P2P payments, social payments, and non-crypto users who want free bank-funded transfers.
