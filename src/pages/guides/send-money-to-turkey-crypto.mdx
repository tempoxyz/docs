# Send Money to Turkey with Crypto

Send money to Turkey instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Turkey's high crypto adoption makes stablecoin transfers particularly seamless.

## The Turkey Corridor

Turkey has one of the highest crypto adoption rates globally, driven partly by currency volatility. The country receives billions in remittances from Germany, the US, and across Europe annually.

Traditional transfer costs:
- SWIFT transfers: $25-50 plus FX spread
- Remittance services: 3-6% fees
- Settlement time: 1-3 business days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to TRY through local exchanges or holds USD

## Off-Ramp Options in Turkey

Turkey's crypto infrastructure is well-developed:
- Major Turkish exchanges (Paribu, BtcTurk, etc.)
- High P2P liquidity
- Growing merchant acceptance
- Option to hold USD stablecoins as inflation hedge

## Why Stablecoins Beat Traditional Transfers

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Speed | 1-3 days | &lt;1 second |
| Fee | 3-6% | ~$0.001 |
| Availability | Business hours | 24/7 |
| Transparency | Hidden spreads | Full visibility |

## USD Stablecoin Advantage

Many Turkish recipients prefer holding USDC:
- Protection against TRY volatility
- Convert to Lira only when needed
- Widely understood and accepted locally
