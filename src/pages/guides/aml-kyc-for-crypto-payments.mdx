# AML and KYC for Crypto Payments

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) programs form the foundation of compliant crypto payment operations. This guide covers the essential components of an effective compliance program for businesses handling stablecoin and cryptocurrency payments.

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal, financial, or regulatory advice. AML/KYC requirements vary by jurisdiction—work with qualified compliance professionals to design your program.

## Regulatory Context

AML/KYC obligations for crypto businesses stem from multiple regulatory frameworks:

- **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA):** US federal AML requirements administered by FinCEN
- **EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (AMLD):** European AML framework, now in its 6th iteration
- **FATF Standards:** Global AML/CFT recommendations adopted by 200+ jurisdictions
- **Local Licensing Requirements:** State/national regulators often impose additional AML obligations

Crypto-specific guidance addresses unique risks including pseudonymous transactions, cross-border transfers, and emerging illicit finance typologies.

## Key Requirements

### AML Program Components

A compliant AML program includes five pillars:

1. **Written Policies and Procedures:** Documented controls tailored to your risk profile
2. **Designated Compliance Officer:** Qualified individual with authority and resources
3. **Training Program:** Regular training for all relevant personnel
4. **Independent Testing:** Periodic audits by internal audit or external parties
5. **Customer Due Diligence (CDD):** Risk-based procedures for identifying and verifying customers

### KYC Requirements

Customer identification and verification typically includes:

- **Identity Verification:** Collect and verify name, date of birth, address, and government ID
- **Beneficial Ownership:** Identify individuals who own or control 25%+ of legal entity customers
- **Customer Risk Rating:** Assign risk scores based on customer type, geography, activity patterns
- **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):** Apply heightened scrutiny for higher-risk customers
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Periodically refresh customer information and risk assessments

### Sanctions Compliance

Screen customers and transactions against:

- OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List
- EU Consolidated Sanctions List
- UN Security Council Sanctions
- Jurisdiction-specific sanctions programs
- Sanctioned wallet addresses and blockchain clusters

## Implementation Guidance

### Building Your KYC Process

1. **Define Customer Tiers:** Establish verification levels based on transaction limits and risk
2. **Select Verification Methods:** Choose appropriate identity verification tools (document verification, biometrics, database checks)
3. **Implement Onboarding Workflows:** Build user flows that collect required information with minimal friction
4. **Configure Risk Scoring:** Develop algorithms incorporating geography, occupation, transaction patterns, and other factors
5. **Establish Review Procedures:** Create workflows for manual review of high-risk customers or verification failures

### Transaction Monitoring

Effective monitoring systems should:

- **Detect Suspicious Patterns:** Identify structuring, rapid movement, unusual transaction sizes
- **Flag High-Risk Counterparties:** Alert on transactions involving high-risk wallets or jurisdictions
- **Incorporate Blockchain Analytics:** Use tools like Chainalysis or Elliptic for on-chain risk assessment
- **Generate Actionable Alerts:** Minimize false positives while capturing genuine risks
- **Support Investigation:** Provide context and visualization tools for alert review

#### Common Red Flags for Crypto Payments

| Red Flag | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Structuring | Breaking transactions to avoid thresholds |
| Mixing/Tumbling | Use of services designed to obscure transaction history |
| Darknet Exposure | Connections to known darknet marketplace wallets |
| Sanctions Nexus | Direct or indirect exposure to sanctioned addresses |
| Rapid Layering | Quick movement through multiple wallets before off-ramping |
| Inconsistent Activity | Transactions inconsistent with stated purpose or customer profile |

### SAR Filing Procedures

When suspicious activity is detected:

1. **Investigate:** Review transaction details, customer history, and blockchain analytics
2. **Document:** Record investigation findings and decision rationale
3. **Escalate:** Route to BSA Officer or compliance committee for filing decision
4. **File Timely:** Submit SARs within 30 days of detection (US requirement)
5. **Maintain Confidentiality:** Do not disclose SAR filings to customers
6. **Retain Records:** Keep SAR documentation for 5+ years

## Best Practices

- **Risk-Based Approach:** Allocate resources proportionate to actual risk exposure
- **Technology Investment:** Leverage automation for screening, monitoring, and case management
- **Vendor Due Diligence:** Thoroughly evaluate compliance technology providers
- **Typology Awareness:** Stay current on emerging crypto money laundering techniques
- **Regulatory Engagement:** Participate in industry forums and respond to regulatory consultations
- **Culture of Compliance:** Foster organization-wide understanding of AML importance
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly assess program effectiveness and address gaps
