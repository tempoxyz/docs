# Tempo vs SWIFT

SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) has been the backbone of international banking for 50+ years, connecting 11,000+ financial institutions. Tempo offers a fundamentally different approach to cross-border payments. This guide compares both.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | SWIFT | Tempo |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Transfer time | 1-5 business days | ~500ms |
| Fees | $25-50+ (plus intermediary fees) | ~$0.001 |
| Intermediaries | 1-4 correspondent banks | None |
| Operating hours | Banking hours only | 24/7/365 |
| Recipient deductions | Common (correspondent fees) | None |
| Transparency | Limited tracking | Full blockchain visibility |
| Minimum practical amount | ~$1,000+ (due to fees) | No minimum |
| Requirements | Bank accounts both sides | Crypto wallets both sides |

## SWIFT Strengths

### Established Global Network

11,000+ financial institutions in 200+ countries. SWIFT is the trusted standard for international bank-to-bank transfers, handling trillions of dollars daily.

### Works With Existing Infrastructure

Senders and receivers use normal bank accounts. No crypto wallets, private keys, or new technology adoption required.

### Regulatory Trust

Decades of regulatory compliance, AML/KYC frameworks, and government oversight. Banks trust SWIFT because it operates within established financial regulations.

### High-Value Transfers

Designed for large institutional transfers. No protocol limits—banks regularly move millions via SWIFT.

### Reversibility When Needed

Transactions can be recalled or amended through banking channels if errors occur (though this takes time).

### Universal Bank Acceptance

Any bank can receive a SWIFT transfer. Recipients don't need to adopt new technology or hold cryptocurrency.

## Tempo Strengths

### Dramatically Faster

~500ms to finality vs 1-5 business days. Tempo transactions complete before a SWIFT message even reaches the first correspondent bank.

| Scenario | SWIFT | Tempo |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Best case | Same day (rare) | ~500ms |
| Typical | 2-3 business days | ~500ms |
| Worst case | 5+ business days | ~500ms |
| Weekend | Delayed until Monday | ~500ms |
| Holiday | Delayed | ~500ms |

### Dramatically Cheaper

~$0.001 flat fee vs $25-50+ that compounds with each intermediary.

| Transfer Amount | SWIFT Fees (typical) | Tempo Fee | Savings |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|---------|
| $1,000 | $25-50 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $10,000 | $35-65 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $100,000 | $45-100 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $1,000,000 | $50-150+ | $0.001 | 99%+ |

*SWIFT fees vary by bank and corridor. Doesn't include correspondent bank deductions.*

### No Intermediary Deductions

SWIFT transfers often arrive short—correspondent banks deduct fees along the way. Send $10,000, recipient might get $9,950. Tempo: send $10,000, recipient gets $10,000 (minus ~$0.001).

### Full Amount Certainty

Know exactly what recipient will receive before sending. No surprise deductions, no "we'll see what arrives."

### 24/7/365 Operation

Works at 3 AM on Christmas Day exactly like Tuesday at noon. No banking hours, no settlement windows, no holiday delays.

### Complete Transparency

Track transactions in real-time on the blockchain. No "your payment is being processed" limbo.

### No Correspondent Bank Chain

Direct transfer, no intermediaries. SWIFT often routes through 2-4 banks, each adding time and potential fees.

## Fee Breakdown: Real Example

**Sending $50,000 from US to Germany:**

### Via SWIFT
- Sending bank fee: $35
- Correspondent bank 1: $15
- Correspondent bank 2: $10
- Receiving bank fee: €20 (~$22)
- **Total: ~$82**
- **Time: 2-4 business days**
- **Recipient receives: ~$49,918**

### Via Tempo
- Transaction fee: $0.001
- **Total: $0.001**
- **Time: ~500ms**
- **Recipient receives: $49,999.999**

## Use Cases: When to Use Each

### Choose SWIFT When

- **Recipients need bank accounts**: Money must arrive at a traditional bank
- **Traditional banking required**: Counterparties won't/can't use crypto
- **Regulatory requirements**: Need auditable bank-to-bank rails
- **Reversibility matters**: May need to recall or amend transfers
- **Established relationships**: Banks prefer working with banks
- **Large institutional transfers**: Internal treasury operations within traditional finance

### Choose Tempo When

- **Both parties have wallets**: Sender and receiver comfortable with crypto
- **Speed critical**: Cannot wait days for settlement
- **Fee sensitive**: Transfer fees eat into margins
- **Predictable amounts**: Recipient must receive exact amount
- **High frequency**: Many transfers where fees compound
- **24/7 operations**: Business runs outside banking hours
- **Small-medium amounts**: SWIFT fees make small transfers impractical

## Example: International Supplier Payments

**Paying 10 suppliers $5,000 each monthly:**

| Method | Per-Payment Cost | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|--------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| SWIFT (~$45 avg) | $45 | $450 | $5,400 |
| Tempo | $0.001 | $0.01 | $0.12 |

*Annual savings: ~$5,400*
*Plus: Suppliers receive payment in seconds instead of days*

## The Infrastructure Question

SWIFT requires:
- Bank accounts (sender and receiver)
- Banking relationships
- Operating within banking hours
- Accepting intermediary involvement

Tempo requires:
- Crypto wallets (sender and receiver)
- Stablecoin holdings
- Comfort with blockchain technology
- On/off ramps if fiat needed

Neither is universally better—it depends on your infrastructure and counterparties.

## Hybrid Approach

Some businesses use both:

1. **SWIFT for**: Traditional suppliers requiring bank payments, regulated transactions needing bank rails, counterparties without crypto infrastructure
2. **Tempo for**: Crypto-comfortable suppliers, urgent payments, frequent transfers, cost-sensitive corridors

## Limitations to Consider

### SWIFT Limitations
- Slow (1-5 business days typical)
- Expensive ($25-50+ plus intermediary fees)
- Unpredictable deductions
- Banking hours only
- Opaque tracking
- High minimum practical amount

### Tempo Limitations
- Requires crypto wallets
- On/off ramp needed for fiat conversion
- Less institutional familiarity
- No reversibility after confirmation
- Recipients must be comfortable with crypto
- Not yet accepted by traditional banks

## The Finality Difference

SWIFT transfers can take days to fully settle, with potential for recalls and amendments during that window.

Tempo transactions are final in ~500ms. This means:
- **Pro**: Instant certainty, no settlement risk
- **Con**: No reversibility if sent to wrong address

Choose based on whether you value speed/certainty or reversibility.

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo is the better choice if you:

- Make regular international payments where both parties have wallets
- Need speed—days vs milliseconds matters
- Want to eliminate correspondent bank fees and deductions
- Operate 24/7 across time zones
- Send amounts where SWIFT fees are disproportionate

SWIFT remains essential for transfers where recipients require traditional bank deposits or operate within traditional banking infrastructure.
