# Crypto Payments for SaaS

SaaS companies lose significant revenue to payment processing fees. Credit card processors charge 2.5-3.5% on every subscription renewal, plus additional fees for failed payments and chargebacks. Stablecoin payments on Tempo reduce processing costs to approximately $0.001 per transaction.

## The SaaS Payment Problem

For a SaaS company with $5M ARR:

| Payment Method | Annual Processing Cost |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Credit cards (2.9% + $0.30) | $150,000+ |
| PayPal | $145,000+ |
| ACH | $25,000 |
| **Tempo stablecoins** | **~$500** |

Beyond direct fees, credit card payments introduce additional costs: failed payment retries, involuntary churn from expired cards, and chargeback management overhead.

## Benefits for SaaS

### Near-Zero Transaction Fees

~$0.001 per transaction regardless of plan tier. A $10/month starter plan and a $10,000/month enterprise plan cost the same to process.

### No Failed Payments

Stablecoin payments don't expire like credit cards. No more involuntary churn from payment method failures or expired cards.

### No Chargebacks

Stablecoin transactions are final. Eliminate chargeback fraud and the operational burden of dispute management.

### Global Subscriptions

Accept payments from customers worldwide without international card fees or currency conversion complexity.

### Instant Settlement

Funds are available immediately. No waiting for weekly or monthly payout cycles from payment processors.

## How It Works

### Recurring Billing

1. Customer authorizes subscription amount and frequency
2. Set up automated payment collection via smart contract or API trigger
3. Tempo executes payment at each billing cycle
4. Customer receives invoice with transaction confirmation
5. Subscription renews automatically

### Usage-Based Billing

For metered or consumption-based pricing:

1. Track customer usage throughout billing period
2. Calculate final amount at cycle end
3. Execute single payment with usage metadata
4. Provide detailed breakdown in customer portal

### Hybrid Models

Combine base subscription fees with usage-based overages:

- Base fee collected on fixed schedule
- Overage charges calculated and collected at period end
- Full metadata for both components

## Implementation

### Subscription Setup

Collect customer wallet address during signup and configure billing:

- Billing frequency (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Payment amount or pricing tier
- Usage thresholds for metered components
- Payment metadata (customer ID, plan tier, contract reference)

### Payment Execution

Trigger payments via API at each billing cycle:

- Generate payment request with invoice metadata
- Customer wallet executes pre-authorized payment
- Tempo confirms transaction instantly
- Update subscription status and send receipt

### Dunning and Retries

Handle insufficient balance scenarios:

- Check wallet balance before payment attempt
- Send proactive low-balance notifications
- Retry logic for temporary balance issues
- Grace period before service suspension

## Integration Options

### API Integration

Build recurring billing directly into your subscription management system. Use webhooks for payment confirmations and failed payment notifications.

### Billing Platform Integration

Connect Tempo payments to existing subscription billing platforms (check [docs.tempo.xyz](https://docs.tempo.xyz) for current integrations).

### Smart Contract Automation

Deploy payment automation on-chain for fully trustless recurring billing without intermediary systems.

## Operational Considerations

- **Pricing**: Display prices in USD, collect equivalent USDC
- **Upgrades/Downgrades**: Prorate changes and adjust next billing amount
- **Refunds**: Process partial or full refunds to customer wallet
- **Accounting**: Export transaction data with subscription metadata
