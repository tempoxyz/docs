# Tempo vs Wise

Wise (formerly TransferWise) disrupted international money transfers with transparent fees and real exchange rates. Tempo offers a blockchain-native alternative. This guide compares both for cross-border payment use cases.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Wise | Tempo |
|---------|------|-------|
| Fee structure | From 0.57% (varies by corridor) | ~$0.001 flat |
| Speed | ~70% instant, rest 1-2 days | ~500ms always |
| FX spread | Near mid-market rate | None (stablecoin swaps) |
| Sender requirements | Bank account, KYC | Crypto wallet |
| Receiver requirements | Bank account | Crypto wallet |
| Coverage | 80+ countries | Global (wallet-to-wallet) |
| Regulatory status | Licensed money transmitter | Blockchain network |
| Maximum transfer | Varies by corridor | No protocol limit |

## Wise Strengths

### Works With Bank Accounts

Senders and receivers use normal bank accounts. No crypto wallets, private keys, or blockchain knowledge required. Enter an email, get paid to your bank.

### Regulated and Trusted

Licensed money transmitter in major jurisdictions. Consumer protections, dispute resolution, and regulatory oversight. Millions of customers trust Wise with their money.

### Transparent Pricing

Real exchange rates with clear, upfront fees shown before you send. No hidden markups. The fee calculator shows exactly what recipient gets.

### Multi-Currency Accounts

Hold balances in 40+ currencies. Get local account details in major markets (USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, etc.). Receive payments like a local.

### ~70% Instant Transfers

Most Wise transfers arrive within seconds to minutes. The remaining ~30% take 1-2 business days depending on local banking infrastructure.

### Broad Coverage

80+ countries supported. Works with existing banking infrastructure—recipients don't need to change anything.

### Customer Support

Real humans to help with issues. Payment tracking, dispute resolution, and account support.

## Tempo Strengths

### Dramatically Lower Fees

~$0.001 flat fee regardless of transfer size. Wise charges percentage-based fees starting at 0.57% (higher for many corridors).

| Transfer Amount | Wise Fee (~0.6-2%) | Tempo Fee | Savings |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| $500 | $3-10 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $2,000 | $12-40 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $10,000 | $60-200 | $0.001 | 99%+ |
| $50,000 | $300-1,000 | $0.001 | 99%+ |

*Wise fees vary significantly by corridor. USD→EUR is cheap (~0.6%), USD→INR is expensive (~1.5%+).*

### Always Instant—100% of the Time

~500ms to finality, every single time. Not "usually instant" or "up to 2 business days"—always sub-second.

| Scenario | Wise | Tempo |
|----------|------|-------|
| Best case | Instant | ~500ms |
| Typical | Minutes to hours | ~500ms |
| Worst case | 1-2 business days | ~500ms |
| Weekend | May delay | ~500ms |
| Bank holiday | May delay | ~500ms |

### No FX Spread on Stablecoins

Send stablecoins, receive stablecoins. Swap between currencies on Tempo's native DEX with minimal spread. No currency conversion markup.

### No Transfer Limits

Protocol imposes no maximum. Wise has corridor-specific limits that can restrict large transfers.

### 24/7/365 Operation

Works identically at 3 AM on Sunday as noon on Tuesday. No banking hours, no settlement windows, no holiday delays.

### Programmable Payments

Smart contracts enable automated payments, escrow, streaming payments, and conditional logic that traditional rails can't support.

## Fee Comparison: Real Corridors

| Corridor | Amount | Wise Fee | Tempo Fee |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| USD → EUR | $5,000 | ~$30 | $0.001 |
| USD → GBP | $5,000 | ~$35 | $0.001 |
| USD → INR | $5,000 | ~$75 | $0.001 |
| EUR → USD | €5,000 | ~€35 | $0.001 |
| GBP → EUR | £5,000 | ~£30 | $0.001 |

## Use Cases: When to Use Each

### Choose Wise When

- **Recipients need bank deposits**: Money must arrive in a traditional bank account
- **No crypto infrastructure**: Neither party wants to manage wallets or private keys
- **Consumer familiarity**: Non-technical users prefer known, regulated brands
- **Multi-currency accounts**: Want to hold EUR, GBP, AUD in local accounts
- **Customer support needed**: Value dispute resolution and payment tracking
- **Regulatory requirements**: Need licensed money transmitter rails

### Choose Tempo When

- **Both parties have wallets**: Sender and receiver comfortable with crypto
- **High-volume transfers**: Fees compound when sending frequently
- **Large transfers**: Percentage-based fees become significant
- **Speed critical**: Must settle in seconds, not hours
- **24/7 operations**: Payments outside banking hours
- **Programmable payments**: Automated, conditional, or streaming
- **No amount limits**: Large transfers without corridor restrictions

## Example: Monthly Contractor Payments

**Paying 5 international contractors $3,000 each monthly:**

| Method | Per-Payment Fee (~1% avg) | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Wise | ~$30 | $150 | $1,800 |
| Tempo | $0.001 | $0.005 | $0.06 |

*Annual savings: ~$1,800*

## Example: Treasury Transfer

**Moving $100,000 between entities:**

| Method | Fee | Time |
|--------|-----|------|
| Wise | ~$600-1,000 | Minutes to 2 days |
| Tempo | $0.001 | ~500ms |

## Hybrid Approach

Many businesses use both:

1. **Wise for**: Contractors requiring bank deposits, one-time payments to new recipients, corridors where recipients lack crypto infrastructure
2. **Tempo for**: Regular payments to crypto-comfortable recipients, large transfers, urgent payments, programmable payment logic

## Limitations to Consider

### Wise Limitations
- Percentage-based fees (expensive for large amounts)
- ~30% of transfers not instant
- Corridor-specific limits and delays
- Banking hours affect some routes
- KYC required for both parties

### Tempo Limitations
- Requires crypto wallets (sender and receiver)
- On/off ramp needed for fiat conversion
- Less mainstream familiarity
- No built-in dispute resolution
- No direct bank integration
- Recipients must be comfortable with crypto

## On/Off Ramp Consideration

Tempo is wallet-to-wallet. If recipients ultimately need fiat currency:

1. Receive stablecoins on Tempo
2. Use exchange or on-ramp service to convert to local currency
3. Withdraw to bank account

This adds a step but may still be cheaper for large amounts. The stablecoin-to-fiat ecosystem is growing rapidly.

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo is the better choice if you:

- Make regular international payments where both parties have wallets
- Transfer large amounts where percentage fees become significant
- Need guaranteed instant settlement (not "usually instant")
- Operate 24/7 across time zones
- Want programmable payment logic
- Hit transfer limits on traditional platforms

Wise remains excellent for transfers where recipients need traditional bank deposits or aren't comfortable with cryptocurrency.
