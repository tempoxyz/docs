# USDC Alternatives on Tempo

Looking for USDC on Tempo? While USDC isn't natively available at launch, Tempo offers several USD-denominated stablecoins designed for fast, low-cost payments.

## Why Look for USDC Alternatives?

Users often search for USDC alternatives due to limitations on other blockchains:

- **High fees:** Ethereum gas costs can exceed $5-50 per transaction during congestion
- **Volatile gas tokens:** Holding ETH or SOL just to pay fees adds complexity
- **Slow settlement:** Waiting minutes for transaction finality disrupts workflows
- **Limited availability:** USDC may not be available or liquid on every chain

Tempo addresses these pain points with stablecoins built specifically for payments.

## USD Stablecoins on Tempo

Tempo supports multiple USD-denominated stablecoins at launch:

| Stablecoin | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **pathUSD** | USD-denominated stablecoin on Tempo |
| **AlphaUSD** | USD-denominated stablecoin on Tempo |
| **BetaUSD** | USD-denominated stablecoin on Tempo |
| **ThetaUSD** | USD-denominated stablecoin on Tempo |

Each stablecoin can be used for payments, swaps, and fee payment on the Tempo network.

## Benefits of Tempo's Native Stablecoins

### Pay Fees in Stablecoins

No ETH or other volatile tokens required. Pay transaction fees directly in the stablecoin you're already holding. Your wallet stays 100% in stable value.

### Sub-Cent Transaction Fees

Tempo transaction fees cost approximately $0.001. Send $10 or $10,000 for the same fee, making micropayments and high-volume transfers equally practical.

### Sub-Second Finality

Transactions finalize in approximately 500 milliseconds. No pending states, no waiting for block confirmations—funds are available immediately.

### 24/7 Availability

Unlike traditional banking rails, Tempo operates continuously. Send and receive stablecoins any time, including weekends and holidays, with instant settlement.

## How to Get Started

1. **Connect your wallet** to the Tempo app
2. **Acquire stablecoins** through supported on-ramps or bridges
3. **Send, receive, or swap** stablecoins with instant finality
4. **Pay fees in stablecoins** directly from your balance

For swapping between stablecoins, Tempo's native exchange executes at oracle prices with sub-cent fees.
