# DAI on Tempo: Availability and Alternatives

DAI is not natively deployed on Tempo at launch. MakerDAO has not issued DAI on Tempo, and there is currently no bridge to bring DAI from other chains. This page explains the current status and the USD stablecoin alternatives available today.

## What is DAI?

DAI is a decentralized, crypto-collateralized stablecoin soft-pegged to the US dollar. MakerDAO governs the protocol, and users mint DAI by depositing collateral into Maker Vaults. The system maintains the peg through overcollateralization and automated stability mechanisms.

**Key facts:**
- **Issuer:** MakerDAO (decentralized governance)
- **Backing:** Overcollateralized crypto assets, real-world assets, and USDC
- **Peg:** 1 DAI ≈ 1 USD (soft peg maintained by protocol mechanisms)
- **Governance:** MKR token holders govern protocol parameters
