# Pay Contractors with Crypto

Paying international contractors through traditional banking is slow and expensive. Wire transfers take days, cost $25-50 each, and often involve unfavorable exchange rates. Stablecoin payments on Tempo solve these problems.

## The Problem with Traditional Contractor Payments

- **High fees**: International wires cost $25-50 per transaction
- **Slow settlement**: 3-5 business days, longer for some countries
- **Currency conversion losses**: Banks take 2-4% on FX spreads
- **Limited banking access**: Many contractors in emerging markets have restricted access

## How Tempo Improves Contractor Payments

### Near-Zero Transaction Costs

Pay contractors for approximately $0.001 per transaction, regardless of the payment amount. A $5,000 contractor payment costs the same as a $500 one.

### Instant Global Settlement

Contractors receive funds in seconds, not days. No bank holidays, no cut-off times, no correspondent banking delays.

### Batch Payments

Pay your entire contractor roster in a single transaction. Upload a CSV with wallet addresses, amounts, and metadata—Tempo processes them all at once.

### Payment Metadata for Compliance

Attach contractor IDs, invoice references, project codes, and tax-relevant information to each payment. This data exports directly to your accounting and payroll systems.

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Pay transaction fees in USDC or other stablecoins. No need to hold volatile crypto assets in your treasury.
