# Send Stablecoins to Europe

Send USD stablecoins to recipients in Europe instantly on Tempo. On-chain FX options like EURC may come later.

## Fast, Cheap Transfers to Europe

Whether you're paying a European vendor, sending money to family, or funding an EU business account, Tempo makes it simple:

- **Instant settlement**: ~0.5 second finality
- **Sub-cent fees**: ~$0.001 per transaction
- **No banking delays**: 24/7 availability, no SWIFT, no correspondent banks

## Available Stablecoins

Tempo currently supports native USD stablecoins:

- **pathUSD** — USD-denominated stablecoin
- **AlphaUSD** — USD-denominated stablecoin
- **BetaUSD** — USD-denominated stablecoin
- **ThetaUSD** — USD-denominated stablecoin

## Sending to European Recipients

Send USD stablecoins directly to your recipient's Tempo address. They can hold the stablecoins or off-ramp through their preferred provider.

### Future: On-Chain FX

Support for EUR-denominated stablecoins like EURC may come later, enabling on-chain USD → EUR conversion before sending to European recipients.

|--------|------|------|--------------|
