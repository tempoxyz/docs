# Bridging Stablecoins to Tempo

This guide covers how to get stablecoins on Tempo, including native options available now and upcoming bridge infrastructure.

## Native Stablecoins on Tempo

Tempo currently offers native stablecoins that are available directly on the network:

- **pathUSD** — USD-denominated stablecoin
- **AlphaUSD** — USD-denominated stablecoin
- **BetaUSD** — USD-denominated stablecoin
- **ThetaUSD** — USD-denominated stablecoin

These stablecoins can be used immediately for payments with Tempo's sub-cent fees and instant finality.

## Bridge Infrastructure

Bridging infrastructure is being developed. Bridge support for external stablecoins like USDC and USDT may come later as the network matures.

### What to Expect

When bridge support launches:

- Transfer stablecoins from Ethereum and other chains to Tempo
- Access Tempo's fast, low-cost payment rails with your existing holdings
- Bridge times will vary by source chain
