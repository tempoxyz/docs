# Send Money to Romania with Crypto

Send money to Romania instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Save on fees for one of Europe's top remittance destinations.

## The Romania Corridor

Romania is among the top remittance recipients in Europe, with significant inflows from Italy, Spain, Germany, and the US. Millions of Romanian workers abroad send money home regularly.

Traditional transfer costs:
- Bank wire: $30-50 plus FX markup
- Remittance services: 3-5% in fees
- Settlement time: 1-3 business days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to RON through local exchanges or services

## Off-Ramp Options in Romania

Your recipient can convert USDC to Romanian Leu through:
- Romanian crypto exchanges
- European exchanges with RON pairs
- P2P platforms
- Crypto-enabled banking apps
