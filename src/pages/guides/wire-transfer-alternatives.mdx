# Wire Transfer Alternatives

Wire transfers are reliable but expensive—$25-50 for domestic wires and $40-80+ for international, plus correspondent bank fees that get deducted along the way. This guide covers alternatives that can save you money while often delivering faster settlement.

## Why Seek Wire Transfer Alternatives?

Wire transfer pain points:

- **High fees**: $25-50 domestic, $40-80+ international
- **Hidden costs**: Correspondent banks deduct $15-30+ from international transfers
- **Slow international**: 1-5 business days through correspondent chains
- **Banking hours only**: No weekends, no holidays
- **Opaque FX rates**: Banks mark up currency conversion 1-4%

## Comparison Table

| Alternative | Domestic Speed | International Speed | Cost | Best For |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|------|----------|
| ACH | 1-2 days | N/A | $0.26-0.50 | Low-cost domestic, non-urgent |
| Same-Day ACH | Same day | N/A | $0.50-1.50 | Urgent domestic, lower cost |
| RTP | Seconds | N/A | $0.01-1.00 | Real-time domestic |
| FedNow | Seconds | N/A | $0.01-0.50 | Real-time via Fed |
| SWIFT gpi | Same day | 1-2 days | $40-80 | Tracked international wires |
| Stablecoins (Tempo) | ~0.5 seconds | ~0.5 seconds | ~$0.001 | Fast, cheap, global |
| Wise | 1-2 days | 1-2 days | 0.5-1.5% | Consumer international |
| PayPal | Instant | 1-4 days | 2.9%+ fees | Consumer/small business |

## When Wire Transfers Are Still Right

Wire transfers have real advantages:

- **Universal bank acceptance**: Works with any bank account worldwide
- **Established legal frameworks**: Clear dispute resolution and compliance
- **Large transaction support**: Routine for million-dollar transfers
- **Institutional trust**: Required for real estate, M&A, legal settlements
- **No recipient setup**: Only bank details needed

For real estate closings, large M&A payments, or situations requiring bank-documented audit trails, wires remain the standard.

### Best For

- Domestic payments where next-day delivery is acceptable

## Hybrid Strategy

Most businesses use multiple rails:
