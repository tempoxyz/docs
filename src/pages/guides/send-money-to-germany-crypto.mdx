# Send Money to Germany with Crypto

Send money to Germany instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Fast, low-cost transfers to Europe's largest economy.

## The Germany Corridor

Germany is Europe's economic powerhouse with significant international business and personal remittance flows. Despite being a major financial center, cross-border transfers still involve traditional banking friction.

Traditional transfer costs:
- SWIFT transfers: $25-50 plus FX spread
- Bank transfers: 1-3% FX markup
- Settlement time: 1-3 business days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to EUR through local exchanges or services

## Off-Ramp Options in Germany

Germany has robust crypto infrastructure:
- German-regulated exchanges (BaFin supervised)
- Major European exchanges
- Crypto-enabled neobanks
- P2P platforms
