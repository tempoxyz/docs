# Stablecoins vs PayPal

PayPal is one of the world's largest payment platforms with 400M+ active accounts. Stablecoins on Tempo offer a different approach to digital payments. This guide compares both for various payment scenarios.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | PayPal | Tempo Stablecoins |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| P2P fee (domestic) | Free (balance/bank) | ~$0.001 |
| Card-funded fee | 2.9% + $0.30 | ~$0.001 |
| International fee | 5%+ (incl. FX) | ~$0.001 |
| FX spread | 3-4% typical | None (stablecoin swaps) |
| Settlement | Instant to PayPal, 1-3 days to bank | ~500ms to wallet |
| Buyer protection | Yes | No |
| Seller protection | Yes (with conditions) | No |
| Account requirements | PayPal account | Crypto wallet |

## PayPal Strengths

### Massive Reach

400M+ active accounts globally. Many consumers already have PayPal. "Pay with PayPal" is widely recognized and trusted.

### Buyer Protection

Disputes, chargebacks, and refunds for qualifying purchases. Consumers feel safe buying from unknown merchants.

### Seller Protection

Protection against unauthorized transactions and chargebacks (with conditions). Established dispute resolution process.

### Free Domestic P2P

Sending money to friends and family in the US is free when funded from PayPal balance or bank account.

### No Crypto Knowledge Required

Works with email addresses and phone numbers. No wallets, private keys, or blockchain concepts.

### Integrated Checkout

One-click checkout on millions of websites. Saved payment methods, shipping addresses, and purchase history.

### Business Tools

Invoicing, recurring billing, reporting, and integration with accounting software. Established business infrastructure.

## Stablecoin Strengths on Tempo

### Dramatically Lower Fees

~$0.001 flat fee regardless of amount or type. PayPal charges 2.9%+ for cards and ~5% for international.

| Transaction Type | PayPal Fee | Tempo Fee |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| $100 domestic (card) | $3.20 | $0.001 |
| $100 international | $5+ | $0.001 |
| $1,000 domestic (card) | $29.30 | $0.001 |
| $1,000 international | $50+ | $0.001 |

### No FX Spread

PayPal's currency conversion typically includes 3-4% spread above mid-market rates. Tempo stablecoin swaps have minimal spread.

**Example: $1,000 USD to EUR**
- PayPal: ~$30-40 in FX costs
- Tempo: ~$0.001 + minimal DEX spread

### True Instant Settlement

~500ms to final settlement in recipient's wallet. PayPal balance is instant, but bank withdrawal takes 1-3 days.

### No Chargebacks

Transactions are final after confirmation. Merchants don't face chargeback risk or disputes. (This is also a limitation for buyers.)

### Programmable Payments

Smart contracts enable automated payments, escrow, streaming, and conditional logic not possible with PayPal.

### 24/7 Global Operation

Works identically worldwide, any time. No account freezes, holds, or regional restrictions.

## Fee Comparison by Scenario

### Personal Payment: $200 to Friend

*PayPal wins for free domestic P2P (bank-funded)*

### Business Payment: $500 Invoice

| Method | Fee | Merchant Receives |

| PayPal (card) | $14.80 | $485.20 |
| PayPal (bank/balance) | $14.80 | $485.20 |
| Tempo | $0.001 | $499.999 |

*Tempo wins for business payments*

### International: $1,000 USD to Europe

| Method | Fee + FX Cost | Recipient Gets (EUR equiv) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------------|
| PayPal | ~$50 (5%) | ~$950 equivalent |
| Tempo (USDC→EURC) | ~$0.01 | ~$999.99 equivalent |

*Tempo dramatically cheaper for international*

## Use Cases: When to Use Each

### Choose PayPal When

- **Consumer e-commerce**: Buyers expect PayPal, want buyer protection
- **Unknown counterparties**: Dispute resolution matters
- **Free P2P**: Domestic friend/family payments (bank-funded)
- **Business tools needed**: Invoicing, reporting, integrations
- **Non-crypto users**: Recipients don't have/want wallets
- **Established checkout**: One-click purchasing experience

### Choose Tempo When

- **Business-to-business**: Known counterparties, no chargebacks needed
- **International payments**: Avoid 5%+ fees and FX spreads
- **High-value transactions**: Percentage fees become significant
- **Programmable payments**: Automated, conditional, streaming
- **Merchant cost savings**: Eliminate 2.9%+ processing fees
- **Crypto-native recipients**: Both parties comfortable with wallets

## Example: E-commerce Business

**$50,000 monthly revenue, 500 orders averaging $100:**

| Method | Processing Cost | Monthly Savings |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| PayPal (2.9% + $0.30) | $1,600 | — |
| Tempo | $0.50 | $1,599.50 |

*Annual savings: ~$19,200*

But consider: Would customers pay with stablecoins? Do you need buyer protection?

## Hybrid Approach

Many businesses accept both:

1. **PayPal for**: Consumer checkout, buyers wanting protection, users without crypto
2. **Tempo for**: B2B payments, crypto-native customers, international suppliers, high-value transactions

Offer stablecoin payment as a discount option (pass some savings to customers).

## Limitations to Consider

### PayPal Limitations
- High fees (2.9%+ cards, 5%+ international)
- Poor FX rates (3-4% spread)
- Account freezes and holds possible
- Chargeback risk for merchants
- 1-3 day bank withdrawal
- Limited programmability

### Tempo Limitations
- No buyer protection
- No dispute resolution
- Requires crypto wallets
- Less consumer familiarity
- No integrated checkout (yet)
- On/off ramp needed for fiat

## The Buyer Protection Tradeoff

PayPal's buyer protection is valuable for:
- Unknown merchants
- Physical goods that might not arrive
- Services that might not be delivered

Tempo's finality is valuable for:
- Merchants tired of chargeback fraud
- Known counterparties
- Digital goods/services
- B2B transactions

Choose based on trust level and use case.

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo stablecoins are the better choice if you:

- Process business payments where buyer protection isn't needed
- Make international payments and want to avoid FX spreads
- Run high-volume operations where percentage fees add up
- Need programmable payment logic
- Have crypto-comfortable counterparties

PayPal remains excellent for consumer e-commerce, buyer protection scenarios, and users who prefer traditional payment methods.
