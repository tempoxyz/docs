# Wise Alternatives

Wise (formerly TransferWise) revolutionized international transfers with transparent fees and real exchange rates. But with fees starting at 0.57% that scale with transfer size, plus delays on some corridors, many users seek alternatives for specific use cases.

This guide compares the top Wise alternatives for 2025, from traditional banks to stablecoins.

## Quick Comparison

| Alternative | Best For | Fee Structure | Speed | Coverage |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-------|----------|
| OFX | Large transfers, business | Spreads vary | 1-2 days | 190+ countries |
| Remitly | Remittances, cash pickup | $0-5 + spread | Minutes-days | 100+ countries |
| WorldRemit | Mobile money, emerging markets | Fixed + spread | Minutes-days | 130+ countries |
| PayPal/Xoom | PayPal users, convenience | 3-5%+ | Minutes-days | 200+ countries |
| Traditional banks | Existing relationships | $25-50 + 3-5% | 3-5 days | Varies |
| Stablecoins | High-value, instant, 24/7 | ~$0.001 flat | ~500ms | Global |
| Wise | Transparent fees, multi-currency | 0.57%+ | Hours-days | 80+ countries |

## Why People Seek Wise Alternatives

### Fees Scale with Amount

Wise's percentage-based fees (0.57%+) become expensive for large transfers:

| Transfer Amount | Wise Fee (~0.7% avg) | Flat Fee Alternative |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| $1,000 | $7 | ~$0.001 (stablecoins) |
| $10,000 | $70 | ~$0.001 |
| $50,000 | $350 | ~$0.001 |
| $100,000 | $700 | ~$0.001 |

### Not Always Instant

Wise claims ~70% of transfers are instant, but the other 30% can take 1-2 business days. For time-sensitive payments, this uncertainty is problematic.

### Corridor Limitations

Some currency routes have higher fees (1-2%+) or slower speeds. USD→INR, for example, can be more expensive than USD→EUR.

### Bank Account Requirements

Both sender and receiver need bank accounts. For recipients in emerging markets who prefer cash pickup or mobile money, Wise doesn't work.
