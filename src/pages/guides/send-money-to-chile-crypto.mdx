# Send Money to Chile with Crypto

Send money to Chile using stablecoins on Tempo. Chile has one of Latin America's most developed regulatory frameworks for crypto, with the 2023 Fintech Law (Law No. 21.521) explicitly recognizing digital assets and establishing clear licensing requirements for exchanges.

## The Chile Corridor

Chile receives remittances primarily from Argentina, the US, and Europe. Traditional costs: wire transfers $30-50, services 3-5%.

## Why Chile Works

- Fintech Law provides legal recognition for crypto as digital financial assets
- Financial Market Commission (CMF) regulates exchanges with clear compliance standards
- Strong banking system with growing crypto integration
- Central Bank exploring stablecoin regulations for payment systems

## How It Works

1. Buy USDC through your preferred exchange
2. Send via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. Recipient converts to Chilean Peso (CLP) on a local exchange
