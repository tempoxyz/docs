# Crypto Payments for Regulated Businesses

Banks, fintechs, and Money Service Businesses (MSBs) are increasingly exploring stablecoin payments to improve settlement speed, reduce costs, and expand service offerings. This guide outlines compliance considerations for regulated entities entering the stablecoin payments space.

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal, financial, or regulatory advice. Consult your compliance team and legal counsel before implementing stablecoin payment capabilities.

## Regulatory Context

Regulated financial institutions face unique considerations when adopting stablecoin payments:

- Existing regulatory relationships and supervisory expectations
- Capital and liquidity requirements that may apply to crypto holdings
- Operational risk management frameworks
- Third-party risk management requirements
- Consumer protection obligations

Regulators including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and state banking departments have issued guidance on crypto-asset activities for supervised institutions.

## Key Requirements

### For Banks and Credit Unions

- **Supervisory Non-Objection:** Many jurisdictions require advance notice or approval before engaging in crypto activities
- **Risk Assessment:** Document comprehensive risk analysis covering credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risks
- **Capital Treatment:** Understand how stablecoin holdings affect capital ratios under applicable frameworks
- **Custody Standards:** Implement appropriate safekeeping controls for digital assets
- **BSA/AML Compliance:** Extend existing Bank Secrecy Act programs to cover stablecoin transactions

### For Fintechs and Payment Companies

- **Licensing Audit:** Review existing licenses to determine if stablecoin activities are covered or require additional authorization
- **Partner Bank Requirements:** If operating under bank partnerships, ensure alignment with partner's crypto policies
- **State Compliance:** Address state-by-state money transmission requirements
- **Consumer Disclosures:** Provide clear disclosures about stablecoin risks and protections (or lack thereof)

### For Money Service Businesses

- **FinCEN Registration:** Ensure MSB registration covers virtual currency activities
- **State Licensing:** Obtain required state money transmitter licenses
- **Enhanced Due Diligence:** Implement heightened scrutiny for higher-risk customers and transactions
- **Agent Oversight:** If using agents, extend compliance monitoring to agent activities

## Implementation Guidance

### Compliance Framework Integration

1. **Gap Analysis:** Compare current compliance program against crypto-specific requirements
2. **Policy Updates:** Revise AML, KYC, and operational policies to address stablecoin specifics
3. **Risk Appetite Definition:** Establish clear parameters for acceptable crypto-related risks
4. **Control Implementation:** Deploy technical and procedural controls for stablecoin transactions
5. **Board Reporting:** Develop metrics and reporting for board-level oversight

### Vendor and Partner Selection

Evaluate service providers across key dimensions:

| Consideration | Key Questions |
|--------------|---------------|
| Regulatory Status | Is the partner appropriately licensed/registered? |
| Compliance Tools | What AML/sanctions screening capabilities are provided? |
| Insurance Coverage | What protections exist for operational failures or theft? |
| Audit Reports | Are SOC 2 or equivalent reports available? |
| Incident Response | What are SLAs for security incidents? |

### Transaction Monitoring Enhancements

Extend monitoring capabilities to address crypto-specific risks:

- **Blockchain Analytics Integration:** Connect with providers like Chainalysis or Elliptic for on-chain risk scoring
- **Wallet Screening:** Screen counterparty wallet addresses against sanctions lists and known illicit actors
- **Cross-Channel Correlation:** Link on-chain activity with traditional banking transactions
- **Typology Updates:** Incorporate crypto-specific red flags into detection scenarios

## Best Practices

- **Start with Clear Use Cases:** Define specific business objectives before expanding crypto capabilities
- **Phased Rollout:** Begin with limited pilots before broad deployment
- **Regulatory Engagement:** Proactively communicate with supervisors about crypto plans
- **Ongoing Training:** Ensure compliance, operations, and customer-facing staff understand stablecoin products
- **Incident Playbooks:** Develop response procedures for crypto-specific scenarios (wallet compromises, blockchain forks, etc.)
- **Regular Reassessment:** Review compliance program as regulations evolve
