# Integrate Tempo Testnet

Tempo is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), targeting the **Osaka** EVM hard fork. So, everything you'd expect to work with Ethereum works on Tempo, with only a few exceptions which we detail on the [EVM Differences](/quickstart/evm-compatibility) page.

If you're interested in learning more about how Tempo works under the hood, feel free to explore the codebase directly, run a node for yourself, or refer to the protocol specifications for a deeper understanding.
