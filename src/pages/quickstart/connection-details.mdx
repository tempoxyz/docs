# Connect to the Network

You can connect with the Tempo Testnet like you would with any other EVM chain.

## Connect using a Browser Wallet

Click on your browser wallet below to automatically connect it to the Tempo Testnet.

<ConnectWallet />

:::warning
Note that on some wallets, you might see an unusually high "balance". This is because, historically, blockchain wallets have always assumed that a blockchain has a "native gas token". On Tempo, there is no native gas token, and so the value shown is a placeholder. See [EVM Differences](/quickstart/evm-compatibility#handling-eth-balance-checks) for more information on this quirk.

## Connect via CLI

To connect via CLI, we recommend using [`cast`](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview/), which is a command-line tool for interacting with Ethereum networks. To install cast, you can read more in the [Foundry SDK docs](/sdk/foundry#get-started-with-foundry).

```bash /dev/null/monitor.sh#L1-11
# Check block height (should be steadily increasing)
cast block-number --rpc-url https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz
```

## Direct Connection Details

### Mainnet

For production deployments, use the mainnet network:

| **Property** | **Value** |
|-------------------|-------|
| **Network Name** | Tempo Mainnet |
| **Currency** | `USD` |
| **Chain ID** | `4217` |
| **HTTP URL** | `https://rpc.tempo.xyz` |
| **WebSocket URL** | `wss://rpc.tempo.xyz` |
| **Block Explorer** | [`https://explore.mainnet.tempo.xyz`](https://explore.mainnet.tempo.xyz) |

:::info
Protocol contracts (pathUSD, Stablecoin DEX, FeeManager) maintain the same addresses on mainnet as on Moderato testnet. See [Predeployed Contracts](/quickstart/predeployed-contracts) for details.

### Testnet (Moderato)

For development and testing, use the Moderato testnet:

| **Property** | **Value** |
|-------------------|-------|
| **Network Name** | Tempo Testnet (Moderato) |
| **Currency** | `USD` |
| **Chain ID** | `42431` |
| **HTTP URL** | `https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz` |
| **WebSocket URL** | `wss://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz` |
| **Block Explorer** | [`https://explore.tempo.xyz`](https://explore.tempo.xyz) |

:::warning
The older testnet (Chain ID `42429`) is being decommissioned. Please migrate to Moderato.
