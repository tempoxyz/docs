# Partner Integration FAQ

This guide answers the most common questions from partners integrating with Tempo mainnet.

## Network Configuration

### What are the mainnet connection details?

| **Property** | **Value** |
|-------------------|-------|
| **Network Name** | Tempo Mainnet |
| **Currency** | `USD` |
| **Chain ID** | `4217` |
| **HTTP URL** | `https://rpc.tempo.xyz` |
| **WebSocket URL** | `wss://rpc.tempo.xyz` |
| **Block Explorer** | [`https://explore.mainnet.tempo.xyz`](https://explore.mainnet.tempo.xyz) |
| **Documentation** | [`https://mainnet.docs.tempo.xyz`](https://mainnet.docs.tempo.xyz) |

### Which testnet should I use?

Use **Moderato** (`https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz`, Chain ID `42431`). The older testnet (Chain ID `42429`) is being decommissioned.

## Gas & Transaction Fees

### How do I get tokens to pay for transactions?

For mainnet partner access, reach out to the Tempo team in your shared Slack channel. We can send pathUSD directly to your wallet address for contract deployment and testing.

Contract deployment typically costs only a few cents. A standard TIP-20 transfer costs less than $0.001.

### What tokens can be used for gas?

Any TIP-20 stablecoin with sufficient liquidity in the Fee AMM can be used for gas. For mainnet, **pathUSD is the recommended token** for contract deployment and transactions until additional liquidity pairs are seeded in the Fee AMM.

### How will users get pathUSD after public mainnet launch?

Bridge will be issuing backed pathUSD, and liquidity pairs will be seeded in the Stablecoin DEX. Users will be able to:

1. Bridge stablecoins from other chains to receive pathUSD
2. Swap other stablecoins for pathUSD on the Stablecoin DEX
3. Receive pathUSD directly from other users or applications

### Can I use my own token for gas fees?

Yes. If you're issuing a TIP-20 stablecoin, you can seed liquidity in the Fee AMM to enable your token for gas payments. See [Managing Fee Liquidity](/guide/stablecoin-dex/managing-fee-liquidity) for details.

**Key points for Fee AMM liquidity:**
- You can seed pairs in the Fee AMM to enable your token
- You'll need to periodically rebalance pools to replace accrued user tokens with validator tokens
- The amount of liquidity needed depends on your rebalance frequency
- Napkin math: gas per tx is ~$0.001, so $1 supports roughly 1,000 transactions

If the pool runs out of liquidity, transactions paying fees in that token will be rejected until it's rebalanced.

## EVM Compatibility

### Do `msg.value` and `address.balance` work on Tempo?

**No.** Tempo has no native token, so:

| Feature | Behavior on Tempo | Alternative |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `msg.value` | Always returns `0` | Use TIP-20 token transfers |
| `address.balance` / `BALANCE` opcode | Always returns `0` | Use TIP-20 `balanceOf(address)` |
| `SELFBALANCE` | Always returns `0` | Use TIP-20 `balanceOf(address(this))` |

Smart contracts that rely on `msg.value` or native balance checks will need to be modified to use TIP-20 tokens instead.

### What about `eth_getBalance` RPC calls?

The `eth_getBalance` RPC method returns an extremely large placeholder value (`0x9612084f0316e0ebd5182f398e5195a51b5ca47667d4c9b26c9b26c9b26c9b2`). This prevents wallet UIs from breaking due to "insufficient balance" errors.

We recommend:
- Removing native balance checks from your UI
- Not displaying any "native balance" to users
- Using TIP-20 `balanceOf` for actual stablecoin balances

See [EVM Differences](/quickstart/evm-compatibility) for complete details.

## Minting & Burning Operations

### What do I need for mint/burn operations?

Mint and burn operations require **pathUSD (or another gas-eligible token) in the same vault/wallet** to pay for gas fees. The minted token itself cannot be used to pay fees for its own minting transaction.

**Example flow:**
1. Ensure your minting wallet holds some pathUSD for gas
2. Call `mint()` or `mintWithMemo()` on your TIP-20 contract
3. Gas fees are paid in pathUSD
4. The full minted amount goes to the recipient

See [Mint Stablecoins](/guide/issuance/mint-stablecoins) for implementation details.

## Contract Deployment

### How much does contract deployment cost?

Contract deployment costs only **a few cents** in pathUSD. Exact costs depend on contract size, but typical deployments are under $0.10.

We typically send partners 5-10 pathUSD for initial contract deployment, which is more than sufficient for most integration needs.

### Do protocol contracts have the same addresses as testnet?

Yes. Tempo protocol contracts (pathUSD, Stablecoin DEX, FeeManager, and all system contracts) maintain the **same addresses on mainnet as on Moderato testnet**.

See [Predeployed Contracts](/quickstart/predeployed-contracts) for the full list.
