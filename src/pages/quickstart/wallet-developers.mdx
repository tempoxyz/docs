# Wallet Integration Guide

Because there is [no native token on Tempo](/quickstart/evm-compatibility#handling-eth-native-token-balance-checks) and transaction fees are paid directly in stablecoins, wallets need specific UI and logic adjustments to support the network. Follow this guide if your wallet logic and/or interfaces are dependent on the existence of a native token.

As part of supporting Tempo in your wallet, you can also deliver an enhanced experience for your users by integrating [Tempo Transactions](/guide/tempo-transaction). Common use cases include enabling a gasless transactions for your users, letting your users decide what token to use for fees, and more.

## Steps

::::steps

### Handle the absence of a native token

If you use `eth_getBalance` to validate a user's balance, you should instead check the user's account fee token balance on Tempo. Additionally, you should not display any "native balance" in your UI for Tempo users.

:::info
In testnet, `eth_getBalance` [returns a large placeholder value](/quickstart/evm-compatibility#handling-eth-native-token-balance-checks) for the native token balance to unblock existing assumptions wallets have about the native token balance.
:::

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { client } from './viem.config'

const userFeeToken = await client.fee.getUserToken({ 
  account: '0x...' 
})

const balance = await client.token.getBalance({ 
  account: '0x...',
  token: userFeeToken.address 
})
```

```ts twoslash [viem.config.ts] filename="viem.config.ts"
// [!include ~/snippets/viem.config.ts:setup]
```
:::

### Configure native currency symbol

If you need to display a native token symbol, such as showing how much gas a transaction requires, you can set the currency symbol to `USD` for Tempo as fees are denominated in USD.

### Use fee token preferences to quote gas prices

On Tempo, users can pay fees in any supported stablecoin. You should quote gas/fee prices in your UI based on a transaction's fee token.

:::info
As a wallet developer, you can set the fee token for your user at the account level.

If you don't, Tempo uses a cascading fee token selection algorithm to determine the fee token for a transaction – learn more about [Fee Token Preferences](/protocol/fees/spec-fee#fee-token-preferences).
:::

### Display token and network assets

Tempo provides a public tokenlist service that hosts token and network assets. You can pull these assets from our public tokenlist service to display in your UI.

- **Tokenlist JSON**: [tempoxyz.github.io/tempo-apps/42431/tokenlist.json](https://tempoxyz.github.io/tempo-apps/42431/tokenlist.json)

### Integrate Tempo Transactions

We strongly recommend using [Tempo Transactions](/guide/tempo-transaction) if you control transaction submission. We have [SDKs and guides](/guide/tempo-transaction#integration-guides) available to get you integrated in less than an hour!

:::tip
Use Tempo Transactions to
- Set the fee token used for your users' transactions ([guide](/guide/payments/pay-fees-in-any-stablecoin))
- Sponsor transaction fees for your users ([guide](/guide/payments/sponsor-user-fees))
- Send concurrent transactions with independent nonces ([guide](/guide/payments/send-parallel-transactions))

## Recipes

### Get user's fee token

Retrieve the user's configured fee token preference:

```ts
import { getUserToken } from 'viem/tempo'

const feeToken = await client.fee.getUserToken({ 
  account: userAddress 
})
```

See [`getUserToken`](https://viem.sh/tempo/actions/fee.getUserToken) for full documentation.

### Get token balance

Check a user's balance for a specific token:

```ts
import { getBalance } from 'viem/tempo'

const balance = await client.token.getBalance({ 
  account: userAddress,
  token: tokenAddress 
})
```

See [`getBalance`](https://viem.sh/tempo/actions/token.getBalance) for full documentation.

### Set user fee token

Set the user's default fee token preference. This will be used for all transactions unless a different fee token is specified at the transaction level. 

```ts
import { setUserToken } from 'viem/tempo'

await client.fee.setUserTokenSync({ 
  token: '0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001', 
})
```

See [`setUserToken`](https://viem.sh/tempo/actions/fee.setUserToken) for full documentation.

## Checklist

Before launching Tempo support, ensure your wallet:

- [ ] Checks fee token balance instead of native balance
- [ ] Hides or removes native balance display for Tempo
- [ ] Displays `USD` as the currency symbol for gas
- [ ] Quotes gas prices in the user's fee token
- [ ] Pulls token/network assets from Tempo's tokenlist
- [ ] (Recommended) Integrates Tempo Transactions for enhanced UX
