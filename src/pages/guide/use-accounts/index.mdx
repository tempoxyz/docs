Create and integrate Tempo accounts into your product with domain-bound passkeys or connecting your app to EVM-compatible wallets.

:::tip
**Should I use a Passkey account or a wallet?**

- If you need a **domain-bound account** experience, you can embed a Passkey account. 
- If you need a **universal account** experience, you can integrate your app with wallets.

You can even use both if you would like to offer both experiences.
