# Tempo Node

Running a Tempo node allows you to interact with the network directly, providing your own RPC access or contributing to network infrastructure. Nodes provide JSON-RPC API access for applications, explorers, and wallets but do not participate in consensus.

## Supported Platforms

Prebuilt binaries are available for:
- **Linux** (x86_64 and ARM64) - requires glibc ≥ 2.38
- **macOS** (ARM64)
