description: Minimum and recommended hardware specs for running Tempo RPC and validator nodes. CPU, RAM, storage, network, and port requirements.

# System Requirements

These are the minimum and recommended system requirements for running a validator/RPC node.
It is likely, that the nodes will not require as much resources at the beginning of the chain,
but we still highly recommend to follow the recommended specifications. This will allow for future growth and scalability.

## RPC Node

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 16 cores | 32+ cores |
| **RAM** | 32 GB | 64 GB |
| **Storage** | 1000 GB NVMe | 2000 GB NVMe |
| **Network** | 1 Gbps | 10 Gbps |

## Validator Node

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 8 cores | 16+ cores |
| **RAM** | 16 GB | 32 GB |
| **Storage** | 100 GB NVMe | 1 TB NVMe |
| **Network** | 1 Gbps | 1 Gbps |

## Cloud provider recommendations

These dedicated servers meet or exceed the recommended specs for both RPC and validator nodes:

| Provider | Server | CPU | RAM | Storage |
|----------|--------|-----|-----|---------|
| OVH | Advance-4 | Intel Xeon-E 2386G (6c/12t) | 32 GB | 2× 512 GB NVMe |
| Hetzner | AX42 | AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (6c/12t) | 64 GB | 2× 512 GB NVMe |
| AWS | `c6id.8xlarge` | 32 vCPUs | 64 GB | 1.9 TB NVMe |

:::warning
Cloud instances with network-attached storage (e.g., AWS EBS) do not provide sufficient I/O performance. Use dedicated servers or instances with local NVMe storage.

## Security measures

We do not recommend using a cloud firewall / NAT gateway as it can introduce additional complexity and performance issues. Instead, we've implemented security measures in the networking layer of the node, including:
- only accepting connections from trusted IP addresses (active validators on-chain)
- ratelimiting connections and messages in consensus and execution to prevent abuse
- only accepting consensus connections from validators that can prove their identity

## Ports

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Expose |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| 30303 | TCP/UDP | Execution P2P | Public |
| 8000 | TCP | Consensus P2P | Validators only |
| 8545 | TCP | HTTP RPC | Optional |
| 8546 | TCP | WebSocket RPC | Optional |
| 9000 | TCP | Metrics | Internal |
