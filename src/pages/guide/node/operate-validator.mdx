# Operate your validator

This guide covers day-to-day operations for running a Tempo validator in production.

## Validator states

Your validator moves through different states during operation. Here's how to identify each.

### DKG ceremony

DKG (Distributed Key Generation) ceremonies run approximately every 3 hours to generate threshold signing shares.

#### Non-dealer / non-player

Your validator is not participating in the current DKG ceremony. This is normal if:
- You're a new validator waiting to join the next ceremony
- The ceremony hasn't started yet

#### Player

Your validator is receiving shares from dealers during the ceremony.

#### Dealer

Your validator is distributing shares to other validators during the ceremony.

#### Checking DKG state

Monitor these metrics to track DKG participation:

```bash
# How many times YOUR node has been a dealer (distributing shares) - this metric should be >0 over 6 hours
curl -s localhost:8002/metrics | grep consensus_engine_dkg_manager_how_often_dealer

# How many times YOUR node has been a player (receiving shares) - this metric should be >0 over 6 hours
curl -s localhost:8002/metrics | grep consensus_engine_dkg_manager_how_often_player

# Successful ceremonies (should increase every ~3 hours)
curl -s localhost:8002/metrics | grep consensus_engine_dkg_manager_ceremony_successes_total

# Failed ceremonies (should stay at 0 or increase rarely)
curl -s localhost:8002/metrics | grep consensus_engine_dkg_manager_ceremony_failures_total
```

If `how_often_dealer` or `how_often_player` is increasing, your node is actively participating in DKG ceremonies.

### Consensus

#### Proposer

Your validator is currently the leader and proposing blocks. Check proposal activity:
```bash
# Number of blocks your node has built and resolved
curl -s localhost:8002/metrics | grep reth_payloads_resolved_block
```

If this counter is increasing, your validator is actively proposing blocks.

#### Voter

Your validator is voting on blocks proposed by others (notarization and finalization). This is the most common state.

```bash
# Inbound voting messages (should increase steadily)
curl -s localhost:8002/metrics | grep consensus_engine_consensus_voter_inbound_messages_total | grep data_0
```

This counter should increase steadily when your node is participating in consensus.

### Execution

#### Catching up

Your node is syncing historical blocks.

```bash
# Check sync stage
curl -s localhost:8002/metrics | grep reth_sync_checkpoint
```

If `reth_sync_checkpoint` shows stages other than `Finish`, you're still syncing.

#### Up to sync

Your node is fully synced and processing new blocks in real-time.

```bash
# Processed height should match or be close to finalized height
curl -s localhost:8002/metrics | grep -E "marshal_finalized_height|marshal_processed_height"
```

Both values should be nearly equal and increasing together.

## Node Lifecycle

### Starting and Stopping

Use `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) or `SIGTERM` to gracefully stop the node:

```bash
# If running directly
kill -INT <pid>

# If running via systemd
sudo systemctl stop tempo
```

The node will finish processing the current block before shutting down. Avoid using `SIGKILL` as it may corrupt the database.

### Resetting your validator's data

:::danger
**You cannot reset a validator's data and continue with the same identity.** Doing so risks inconsistent voting, which can cause irrecoverable network safety failures. See [Recovery procedures](/guide/node/troubleshoot-validator#recovery-procedures) for the correct process.
:::

If you need to reset your validator's data, you must rotate to a new validator identity. This requires coordinating with the Tempo team to deactivate your old identity and register a new one.

## Key Management

### Signing Key Rotation

To rotate your validator's signing key:

1. Generate a new keypair:

```bash
tempo consensus generate-private-key --output <new-key-path>
tempo consensus calculate-public-key --private-key <new-key-path>
```

2. Contact the Tempo team to update your validator's public key on-chain

3. Once confirmed, update your node configuration to use the new key and restart

:::warning
The old validator identity must be deactivated before the new one is activated
:::

### Signing Share Recovery

:::danger
**You cannot reset a validator's data and continue with the same identity.** Doing so risks inconsistent voting, which can cause irrecoverable network safety failures. See [Recovery procedures](/guide/node/troubleshoot-validator#recovery-procedures) for the correct process.
:::

If you lose your signing share (stored on the database in `<datadir>/consensus/`), you will need to rotate to a new validator identity. This requires coordinating with the Tempo team to deactivate your old identity and register a new one.
We're planning to release a high-availability feature that allows storing consensus data in an external database, which will enable signing share recovery without the need for key rotation.

## Log Management

### Parsing Logs

Tempo logs include ANSI escape codes for colors. To strip them for grep/awk:

```bash
# Strip colors when searching
sudo journalctl -u tempo | sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g' | grep "error"

# Or disable colors at runtime
RUST_LOG_STYLE=never tempo node ...
```

### Log Levels

Control verbosity with `RUST_LOG`:

```bash
# Default (info)
RUST_LOG=info

# Debug consensus only
RUST_LOG=info,tempo_commonware_node::consensus=debug

# Quiet mode (warnings and errors only)
RUST_LOG=warn
```

## Metrics glossary

This is a table of the most important metrics to watch on your validator node:

| Metric Name | Description | When to alert? | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `consensus_engine_dkg_manager_ceremony_successes_total` | Number of successful DKG ceremonies | Critical when it hasn't increased in 12 hours | Your node has participated in a successful DKG ceremony |
| `consensus_engine_dkg_manager_ceremony_failures_total` | Number of failed DKG ceremonies | Warning when it increases | Your node has failed to participate in a DKG ceremony |
| `consensus_engine_marshal_finalized_height` | Latest finalized height your node is aware of | Warning when it hasn't increased in 1 hour, critical when it hasn't increased in 3 hours | Your node is aware of the latest finalized height |
| `consensus_engine_marshal_processed_height` | Latest height your node has processed | Critical when it hasn't increased in an hour, warning when it's behind finalized height | Your node is processing blocks |
| `consensus_network_spawner_connections` | Number of active peers on the consensus layer | Warning when it's below the expected validator count, critical when it's 0 | Your node is connected to the consensus layer |
| `consensus_engine_consensus_voter_inbound_messages_total` | Number of inbound messages related to voting on the consensus layer | Warning when it's not increasing and your node is synced | Your node is receiving voting messages from the consensus layer |
| `reth_sync_checkpoint` | Current sync progress | Warning on when there are no changes in the `Finish` stage | Your node is syncing with the network |
| `reth_payloads_resolved_block` | Number of built and resolved payloads | Warning when it hasn't increased in 12 hours | Your node has built and resolved blocks |
