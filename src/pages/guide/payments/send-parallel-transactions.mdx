# Send Parallel Transactions

Tempo enables concurrent transaction execution through its [expiring nonce](/guide/tempo-transaction#expiring-nonces) system. Unlike traditional sequential nonces that require transactions to be processed one at a time, expiring nonces allow multiple transactions to be submitted simultaneously without nonce conflicts. Each transaction uses an independent nonce that automatically expires after a set time window, enabling true parallel execution.

## Demo

By the end of this guide you will understand how to send parallel payments using expiring nonces under-the-hood.

<Demo.Container name="Send Parallel Payments" footerVariant="balances" tokens={[Token.alphaUsd]}>
  <Step.Connect stepNumber={1} />
  <Step.AddFunds stepNumber={2} />
  <Step.SendParallelPayments stepNumber={3} />
</Demo.Container>

## Steps

::::steps

### Set up Wagmi & integrate accounts

Ensure that you have set up your project with Wagmi and integrated accounts by following either of the guides:

- [Embed Passkey accounts](/guide/use-accounts/embed-passkeys)
- [Connect to wallets](/guide/use-accounts/connect-to-wallets)

### Send concurrent transactions with nonce keys

To send multiple transactions in parallel, simply batch them together. [Expiring nonces](/guide/tempo-transaction#expiring-nonces) are attached to each transaction automatically.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @noErrors
import { Hooks } from 'wagmi/tempo'
import { parseUnits } from 'viem'

const alphaUsd = '0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001'

const { mutate: transfer } = Hooks.token.useTransferSync()

// Send both transfers in parallel. // [!code focus]
const [receipt1, receipt2] = await Promise.all([ // [!code focus]
  transfer.mutate({ // [!code focus]
    amount: parseUnits('100', 6), // [!code focus]
    to: '0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8', // [!code focus]
    token: alphaUsd, // [!code focus]
  }), // [!code focus]
  transfer.mutate({ // [!code focus]
    amount: parseUnits('50', 6), // [!code focus]
    to: '0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC', // [!code focus]
    token: alphaUsd, // [!code focus]
  }), // [!code focus]
]) // [!code focus]

console.log('Transaction 1:', receipt1.transactionHash) // [!code focus]
console.log('Transaction 2:', receipt2.transactionHash) // [!code focus]
```

```tsx twoslash [wagmi.config.ts] filename="wagmi.config.ts"
// @noErrors
// [!include ~/snippets/wagmi.config.ts:setup]
```
