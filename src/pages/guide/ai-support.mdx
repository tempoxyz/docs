# AI Support

Tempo documentation is built with AI-first principles, providing multiple features to make documentation accessible to LLMs and AI assistants.

## llms.txt

The docs automatically generate [`llms.txt`](https://llmstxt.org/) files for LLM consumption:

- `/llms.txt` – A concise index of all pages with titles and descriptions
- `/llms-full.txt` – Complete documentation content in a single file

These files are generated at build time and served at the root of the site.

## Markdown Rendering for AI Agents

AI user agents are automatically detected and served raw Markdown instead of rendered HTML. This provides better token efficiency and easier parsing for LLMs.

### Supported AI Agents

Popular user agents that are automatically detected:

- **OpenAI**: `GPTBot`, `ChatGPT-User`
- **Anthropic**: `ClaudeBot`, `claude-web`
- **Google**: `Googlebot`

See the [full list of supported agents](https://github.com/wevm/vocs/blob/next/src/waku/internal/middleware/md-router.ts#L3) for the most up-to-date list.

### Manual Markdown Access

Any page can be accessed as Markdown by appending `.md` to the URL:

```
https://docs.tempo.xyz/quickstart/integrate-tempo.md
```

This is useful for copying documentation into AI conversations or for custom integrations.

## Ask AI Menu

The docs include a built-in "Ask AI" menu (<kbd>⌘I</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+I</kbd>) that provides:

- **Open in ChatGPT/Claude**: Opens the current page context in popular AI assistants
- **Copy page for AI**: Copies the page content as Markdown to your clipboard
- **View as Markdown**: Opens the raw Markdown version of the current page
- **Copy MCP URL**: Copies the MCP server URL for AI assistant configuration

## MCP Server

The docs include a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that allows AI assistants to navigate documentation and source code programmatically.

### Connecting AI Assistants

Configure your AI assistant to connect to the MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tempo-docs": {
      "url": "https://docs.tempo.xyz/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

The MCP server exposes these tools to AI assistants:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `list_pages` | List all documentation pages with their paths |
| `read_page` | Read the content of a specific documentation page |
| `search_docs` | Search documentation for a query string |

### Source Code Navigation

The MCP server also provides access to source code repositories:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `list_sources` | List available source code repositories |
| `list_source_files` | List files in a directory |
| `read_source_file` | Read a source code file |
| `get_file_tree` | Get a recursive file tree |
| `search_source` | Search source code for a pattern |

Available source repositories:

- [`tempoxyz/tempo`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo) – Tempo node implementation
- [`tempoxyz/tempo-ts`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/tempo-ts) – TypeScript SDK
- [`paradigmxyz/reth`](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) – Reth Ethereum client
- [`foundry-rs/foundry`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) – Foundry development toolkit
- [`wevm/viem`](https://github.com/wevm/viem) – TypeScript interface for Ethereum
- [`wevm/wagmi`](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi) – React hooks for Ethereum

## Agent Skills

Install the [Tempo Agent Skills](https://github.com/tempoxyz/agent-skills) to give AI coding agents (Amp, Claude Code, etc.) access to Tempo documentation, source code via MCP, and examples. Check out [`tempoxyz/agent-skills`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/agent-skills) for more info on available skills.

### Installation

```bash
npx skills add tempoxyz/agent-skills
```

Or manually:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tempoxyz/agent-skills.git
$ cp -r agent-skills/skills/tempo ~/.config/agents/skills/
```

Or add to your project's [`.agents/skills/`](https://github.com/tempoxyz/agent-skills/tree/main/skills) directory for project-specific access.

### Usage

Once installed, the skill is automatically available. The agent will use it when relevant tasks are detected.

**Examples:**

```
How do I create a TIP-20 stablecoin?
```
```
Show me how fee sponsorship works in Viem
```
```
Search the Tempo source for transaction validation
```
