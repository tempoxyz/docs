## Use Tempo Transactions

Tempo Transactions are a new [EIP-2718](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2718.md) transaction type, exclusively available on Tempo.

:::note[SDKs Support]
Transaction [SDKs](#integration-guides) are available for TypeScript, Rust, Go, and Foundry.
:::

If you're integrating with Tempo, we **strongly recommend** using Tempo Transactions, and not regular Ethereum transactions. Learn more about the benefits below, or follow the guide on issuance [here](/guide/issuance).
