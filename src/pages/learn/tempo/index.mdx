# Tempo [The payments-first blockchain]

Tempo is a general-purpose blockchain optimized for payments, built to deliver instant, deterministic settlement, predictably low fees, and a stablecoin-native experience. Tempo's public testnet launched on December 9, 2025, and is now available for anyone to start building on.

Tempo was designed in close collaboration with an exceptional group of [design partners](https://tempo.xyz/ecosystem) who are helping to validate the system against real payment workloads.

The general-purpose programmability of the blockchain provides functionality directly in support of our global payments mission: stablecoin interoperability, onchain FX, compliant privacy, and more. Tempo will be a permissionless, decentralized chain. The Tempo client is open source under the Apache license, and anyone can run a node or sync the chain.
