# Stablecoins [Room-temperature superconductors for financial services.]

Stablecoins offer businesses a faster, cheaper, and more programmable way to move money globally. They eliminate many of the delays, costs, and operational constraints of legacy rails, enabling use cases ranging from remittances and global payouts to automated treasury operations and agentic commerce.

## What are stablecoins?

Stablecoins are digital representations of money on blockchains designed to hold a steady value. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether, whose prices fluctuate based on market conditions, stablecoins are pegged to established currencies like the U.S. dollar or Euro.

Real-world utility, increasing regulatory clarity, and growing institutional adoption are driving rapid growth in stablecoin usage. The circulating supply of stablecoins has grown more than tenfold over the past five years, reaching roughly $300 billion today. The U.S. Treasury now projects that this figure could rise to $3 trillion by 2030.

## How stablecoins work

Fully-reserved fiat-backed stablecoins are issued by regulated entities ("stablecoin issuers") and are backed 1&#58;1 with reserves such as cash and short-term government securities held at licensed financial institutions. Stablecoin issuers use a mint-and-burn process to keep the supply aligned with underlying reserves and ensure that holders can always redeem stablecoins at face value.

When a user deposits fiat currency with an issuer, the issuer mints the corresponding amount of stablecoins onchain and sends them to the user. When the user later redeems stablecoins for fiat, the issuer receives the tokens, burns them, and sends the equivalent amount of fiat from its reserves to the user.

With the introduction of regulatory frameworks like MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) in the EU and the GENIUS Act in the U.S., stablecoins now operate under clearer rules governing reserve management, audits, and disclosures. As a result, they have become compliant, transparent, and reliable instruments for modern payments and financial operations.

## Why stablecoins matter for businesses

For financial institutions, corporations, and payment providers, fully-reserved fiat-backed stablecoins enable near-instant payments that operate 24/7, work across borders, and bypass much of the friction found in legacy payment rails.

They support established use cases such as remittances, global payouts, and embedded finance, while also enabling newer applications made possible by blockchain rails, including microtransactions and agentic commerce.

## Programmable money

Stablecoins also open the door to programmable money: smart contracts, programs that run on the blockchain, can execute payments automatically based on predefined rules or conditions, improving the efficiency and transparency of payment processing, liquidity management, and reconciliation.

For example, a global enterprise can use a smart contract to automatically top up or sweep the wallets of its subsidiaries based on balance thresholds and predefined rules. This allows routine treasury actions, such as maintaining minimum operating balances or consolidating excess funds, to run automatically onchain. In practice, the smart contract replaces functionality that would otherwise require custom integrations with multiple banking partners.

In short, stablecoins provide the stability and familiarity of fiat currency with the speed and innovation of blockchains, offering institutions and enterprises of all sizes a faster, more efficient way to move value globally.

## History of stablecoins

Stablecoins emerged as a solution to cryptocurrency's volatility problem. Tether (USDT), launched in 2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Omni Layer protocol, pioneered the concept of a dollar-pegged digital asset. MakerDAO introduced DAI in 2017, creating the first decentralized, crypto-collateralized stablecoin governed by smart contracts. Circle and Coinbase followed in 2018 with USD Coin (USDC), emphasizing regulatory compliance and transparent reserves.

The 2020 "DeFi Summer" marked an inflection point for stablecoin adoption. Total stablecoin market capitalization surged from under $10 billion to over $100 billion by 2021, as they became essential infrastructure for lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and yield farming. This explosive growth attracted regulatory attention worldwide.

Regulatory frameworks are now taking shape globally. The European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, finalized in 2023, established comprehensive stablecoin requirements including reserve mandates and issuer licensing. In the United States, the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) represents ongoing legislative efforts to create a federal framework for stablecoin issuance and oversight.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is a stablecoin?

A stablecoin is a digital currency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1&#58;1 to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins combine the speed and programmability of blockchain with the price stability businesses need for payments and treasury operations.

### Are stablecoins safe?

The safety of a stablecoin depends on its backing and the issuer's transparency. Regulated stablecoins like USDC maintain full reserves in cash and short-term US Treasuries, with regular third-party attestations. Always verify a stablecoin's reserve composition and regulatory status before using it for business operations.

### How are stablecoins different from other cryptocurrencies?

Stablecoins maintain a fixed value while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum fluctuate based on market demand. This price stability makes stablecoins practical for business payments, payroll, and cross-border transactions where you need predictable values rather than speculative assets.

### What are stablecoins used for?

Businesses use stablecoins for cross-border payments, vendor settlements, payroll for international contractors, and treasury management. Stablecoins enable near-instant settlement at a fraction of traditional wire transfer costs, often completing in seconds rather than days.

### How do I get stablecoins?

You can acquire stablecoins through regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, direct purchases from issuers like Circle, or through payment platforms that support stablecoin on-ramps. Enterprise users typically work with licensed custodians or payment providers that handle compliance and custody requirements.

### Are stablecoins regulated?

Stablecoin regulation varies by jurisdiction and is rapidly evolving. Major stablecoin issuers operate under state money transmitter licenses in the US, and new frameworks like the EU's MiCA regulation are establishing clear compliance requirements. Work with legal counsel to understand the regulatory requirements for your specific use case and geography.

### What is counterparty risk in stablecoins?

Counterparty risk refers to the possibility that a stablecoin issuer fails to maintain adequate reserves or becomes insolvent. Major issuers like Circle publish monthly reserve attestations, but these are point-in-time snapshots. Stablecoins backed by cash and T-bills carry less risk than those backed by commercial paper or less liquid assets.

### What regulatory risks should I consider?

Regulatory frameworks are still evolving globally. A stablecoin compliant in one jurisdiction may face restrictions elsewhere. The EU's MiCA regulation and the US GENIUS Act are establishing clearer rules, but businesses should verify their chosen stablecoin's regulatory status and issuer licensing in all relevant jurisdictions.
