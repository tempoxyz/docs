# Stablecoins vs Wire Transfers

Wire transfers are the standard for large, time-sensitive payments—especially internationally. Stablecoins on Tempo offer an alternative with different tradeoffs. This guide compares both for various payment scenarios.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Domestic Wire | International Wire (SWIFT) | Tempo Stablecoins |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Sender fee | $25-50 | $40-50+ | ~$0.001 |
| Correspondent fees | None | $15-30+ (often deducted) | None |
| Settlement time | Same day | 1-5 business days | ~0.5 seconds |
| Availability | Banking hours | Banking hours | 24/7/365 |
| FX spread | N/A | 1-4% typical | None (stablecoin swaps) |
| Receiver requirements | Bank account | Bank account | Crypto wallet |
| Reversibility | Difficult but possible | Difficult but possible | Final |

## Wire Transfer Strengths

### Universal Bank Compatibility

Wire transfers work with virtually any bank account worldwide. SWIFT connects 11,000+ institutions across 200+ countries. No special infrastructure or wallets needed.

### Established Legal Frameworks

Decades of international banking law, correspondent relationships, and regulatory oversight. Clear processes for disputes, errors, and compliance.

### Large Transaction Support

Wires handle multi-million dollar transfers routinely. Established processes for KYC/AML on large transactions.

### Institutional Trust

Banks, corporations, and governments rely on wires for critical payments. Real estate closings, M&A transactions, and trade finance depend on wire infrastructure.

### No Technology Adoption Required

Recipients need only a bank account. No apps, wallets, or crypto knowledge required.

## Stablecoin Strengths on Tempo

### Dramatically Lower Fees

At ~$0.001 per transaction, Tempo costs a fraction of wire fees. No correspondent bank fees eating into the transfer amount.

| Transfer Amount | Wire Cost (International) | Tempo Cost |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------|
| $1,000 | $50-80 (5-8%) | $0.001 |
| $10,000 | $50-80 (0.5-0.8%) | $0.001 |
| $100,000 | $50-80 (0.05-0.08%) | $0.001 |

### True Instant Settlement

~0.5 seconds to finality, not 1-5 business days. Sender and receiver see the same balance immediately.

### No Correspondent Bank Deductions

SWIFT transfers often arrive with $15-30+ deducted by intermediary banks. Tempo transfers arrive complete.

### 24/7 Operation

Send payments Friday evening, receive Friday evening. No waiting for Monday, no banking holiday delays.

### Transparent Fees

Know exactly what you pay. No hidden FX spreads or surprise correspondent charges.

*Using USDC or converting via Tempo's native DEX with minimal spread*

## Settlement Time Comparison

|----------|---------------|-------|
| Domestic urgent | Same day (cutoff times apply) | Instant |
| International | 1-5 business days | Instant |
| Weekend payment | Next business day | Instant |
| Holiday period | Delayed | Instant |
| Time zone difference | May add days | No impact |

## Use Cases: When to Use Each

### Choose Wire Transfers When

- **Recipients require bank accounts**: Vendors, employees, or partners without crypto infrastructure
- **Regulatory requirements**: Transactions requiring bank-based audit trails
- **Real estate and legal**: Closings, escrow, court-ordered payments
- **Trade finance**: Letters of credit, documentary collections
- **Maximum institutional trust**: Conservative counterparties prefer traditional rails

### Choose Tempo When

- **Speed is critical**: Real-time settlement needed
- **Cost optimization**: High-value transfers where wire fees add up
- **Frequent international payments**: Regular cross-border operations
- **24/7 requirements**: Payments outside banking hours
- **Transparent pricing**: Avoid hidden fees and FX spreads
- **Multi-currency operations**: Hold and swap between USD, EUR stablecoins

## Example: Monthly International Payroll

**20 contractors across 5 countries, paid monthly:**

| Method | Per-Payment Cost | Monthly Total | Annual Cost |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| SWIFT Wire | $60 avg | $1,200 | $14,400 |
| Tempo | $0.001 | $0.02 | $0.24 |

*Annual savings: $14,399.76*

## Hybrid Approach

Many businesses use both strategically:

1. **Wires for**: One-time large payments to traditional banks, regulated transactions requiring bank records, recipients without crypto capability
2. **Tempo for**: Regular international payments, time-sensitive transfers, high-frequency settlements, cost-sensitive transactions

## Limitations to Consider

### Wire Transfer Limitations
- High fees (especially international)
- Slow settlement (1-5 days international)
- Hidden correspondent charges
- Banking hours only
- Opaque FX conversion
- Difficult to track in transit

### Tempo Limitations
- Requires recipient crypto wallet
- Stablecoin on/off ramp needed for fiat conversion
- Less institutional familiarity
- No built-in dispute resolution
- Newer technology

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo stablecoins are the better choice if you:

- Make regular international payments
- Need instant settlement regardless of time zone
- Want to eliminate correspondent bank fees
- Require transparent, predictable costs
- Operate outside banking hours
- Recipients can accept stablecoins

Wire transfers remain essential when recipients require traditional bank deposits or regulatory frameworks mandate bank-based payments.
