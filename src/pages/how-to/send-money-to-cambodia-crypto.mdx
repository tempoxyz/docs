- Wire transfers: $25-45 + FX spreads
- Remittance services: 5-8% fees

## Why Crypto Works Perfectly for Cambodia

Cambodia's unique economy makes stablecoins especially effective:
- **Dollarized economy** — USD widely used alongside Khmer Riel
- Growing mobile money adoption
- Limited traditional banking in rural areas
- Rising smartphone penetration

## How to Send

1. **Buy USDC** on any exchange or on-ramp
2. **Send to Cambodian recipient** via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Instant arrival** — recipient sees funds in seconds
4. **Use directly or convert** — USDC often usable as-is in USD economy

## Off-Ramp Options

## Cost Comparison

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Speed | 2-5 days | &lt;1 second |
| Cost | 5-8% | ~$0.001 |
| Access | Banking hours | 24/7 |
| Currency | KHR conversion needed | USD-stable value |

## Unique Advantage: Dollarized Economy

- Storing value without local currency volatility
- Easier conversion when needed
