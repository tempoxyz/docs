# Send Money to Spain with Crypto

Send money to Spain instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Perfect for US-Spain and Latin America-Spain connections.

## The Spain Corridor

Spain serves as a key hub connecting Latin America with Europe due to shared language and cultural ties. The country receives significant remittances from the US and also facilitates flows between LATAM and Europe.
