# Send Money to Guatemala with Crypto

Send money to Guatemala using stablecoins on Tempo. Latin America's second-largest remittance corridor deserves better than 6-8% fees.

## The Guatemala Corridor

Guatemala receives over $22 billion in remittances annually, second only to Mexico in Latin America. Remittances represent roughly 18% of GDP, making them essential to the economy.

Traditional remittance costs:
- Wire transfers: $25-45 per transaction
- Remittance services: 6-8% in fees
- Delivery: 1-4 days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to GTQ through local exchanges or P2P

## Off-Ramp Options in Guatemala

Your recipient can convert USDC to Guatemalan Quetzals through:
- Local crypto exchanges
- P2P marketplaces (growing rapidly)
- Regional exchanges serving Central America
- Crypto-to-mobile-money services

## Cost Comparison

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Speed | 1-4 days | &lt;1 second |
| Fee | 6-8% | ~$0.001 |
| Availability | Business hours | 24/7 |
| FX Rate | Hidden spreads | Transparent |
