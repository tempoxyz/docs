# Send Money to Poland with Crypto

Send money to Poland instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Skip the high remittance fees common in diaspora corridors.

## The Poland Corridor

Poland receives billions annually in remittances, particularly from the US, UK, and Germany. The Polish diaspora is one of the largest in Europe, with millions sending money home regularly.

Traditional transfer costs:
- Wire transfers: $25-45 plus FX spread
- Remittance services: 3-6% fees
- Settlement time: 1-3 business days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to PLN through local exchanges or services

## Off-Ramp Options in Poland

Your recipient can convert USDC to Polish Zloty through:
- Polish crypto exchanges (Zonda, BitBay)
- European exchanges with PLN support
- P2P marketplaces
- Crypto-friendly fintech apps
