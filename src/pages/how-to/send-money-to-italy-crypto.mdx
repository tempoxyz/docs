# Send Money to Italy with Crypto

Send money to Italy instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Skip the traditional fees on one of Europe's largest remittance corridors.

## The Italy Corridor

Italy has one of the largest diaspora populations globally, with significant communities in the US, Argentina, and throughout Europe. Traditional remittance flows to Italy involve billions annually.

Traditional transfer costs:
- SWIFT transfers: $25-50 plus FX spread
- Remittance services: 3-5% fees
- Settlement time: 1-3 business days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to EUR through local exchanges or services

## Off-Ramp Options in Italy

Your recipient can convert USDC to Euros through:
- Italian and European crypto exchanges
- Banking apps with crypto features
- P2P marketplaces
- Crypto-enabled fintech services

## Why Stablecoins Beat Traditional Remittances
