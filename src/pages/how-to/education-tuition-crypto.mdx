# Education Tuition with Crypto

International student payments are expensive and slow. Wire transfers from overseas families incur significant fees, and currency conversion erodes tuition dollars before they reach the institution. Stablecoin payments on Tempo deliver nearly 100% of tuition funds with instant confirmation.

## The International Tuition Problem

| Payment Method | Fees | Settlement | Reconciliation |
|---------------|------|------------|----------------|
| International wire | $40-75 | 3-5 days | Manual matching |
| Currency conversion | 2-4% markup | Immediate | FX tracking |
| Third-party flywire/similar | 1-2% | 2-4 days | Platform-dependent |
| Credit card (intl) | 3-4% + cross-border | 1-3 days | Automated |
| **Tempo** | **~$0.001** | **Instant** | **Automated** |

For a $50,000 annual tuition payment from an international student:

| Cost Component | Traditional | Tempo |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Wire transfer fee | $50 | ~$0.001 |
| Currency conversion (3%) | $1,500 | $0* |
| **Total fees** | **$1,550** | **~$0.001** |

*Families transact directly in stablecoins

## Benefits for Educational Institutions

### Reduced Payment Friction

International families pay as easily as domestic ones. Remove wire transfer complexity that delays enrollment confirmation.

### Lower Processing Costs

Eliminate third-party international payment processor fees. Those savings can reduce student costs or fund institutional priorities.

### Instant Payment Confirmation

Confirm tuition payment immediately. No waiting for wire clearance before finalizing enrollment or releasing registration holds.

### Simplified Reconciliation

Transaction metadata enables automatic matching to student accounts. Reduce bursar office manual processing.

### Global Student Access

Accept payments from students in any country without geographic payment restrictions.

## How It Works

### Tuition Payment Flow

1. Institution generates tuition bill with stablecoin payment option
2. Student receives payment instructions with enrollment metadata
3. Student (or family) sends stablecoins from wallet
4. Institution receives instant confirmation
5. Student account credited and enrollment finalized

### Payment Metadata

Attach enrollment context to each transaction:

- Student ID
- Term/semester
- Payment type (tuition, housing, fees, meal plan)
- Invoice reference
- Payment plan installment number (if applicable)
- Scholarship/aid offsets

### Payment Plans

Support installment-based tuition:

1. Define payment schedule with amounts and due dates
2. Student authorizes recurring payments
3. Execute payment at each installment
4. Track payment plan status in student account

## Implementation

### For Bursar Offices

1. Set up institutional payment wallet
2. Integrate stablecoin option into student billing portal
3. Generate unique payment references per student/term
4. Monitor incoming payments via webhook
5. Auto-post to student accounts using metadata

### For International Admissions

1. Include stablecoin payment information in acceptance materials
2. Provide clear instructions for deposit and tuition payments
3. Confirm enrollment deposits instantly
4. Reduce payment-related enrollment delays

### For Study Abroad Programs

1. Collect program fees from students before departure
2. Pay partner institutions and vendors in destination countries
3. Eliminate international wire fees on both collection and disbursement
4. Track expenses with program metadata

## Use Cases

### International Student Tuition

Families in Asia, Middle East, or Latin America pay US institution tuition without losing $1,000+ to fees per semester.

### Study Abroad Programs

Students pay program fees and institutions pay overseas partners, both avoiding international wire costs.

### Language Schools and Short Programs

International students in intensive programs pay deposits and tuition without wire delays affecting start dates.

### Boarding Schools

International families pay tuition, room, and board without cumulative wire fees across multiple payment types.

### Scholarship Disbursements

Foundations and donors send scholarship funds to international students directly with minimal fees.

## Compliance Considerations

- **Financial Aid Coordination**: Ensure stablecoin payments integrate with Title IV and institutional aid calculations
- **1098-T Reporting**: Include transaction details for tax document generation
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable records support financial audits and accreditation reviews
- **International Compliance**: Implement appropriate verification per jurisdiction requirements
