# Tempo vs Ethereum for Payments

Ethereum pioneered programmable money and hosts the largest stablecoin ecosystem. Tempo is a newer chain purpose-built for stablecoin payments. This guide compares both for payment use cases.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Ethereum L1 | Ethereum L2s | Tempo |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Transaction fee | $1-50+ | $0.01-0.50 | ~$0.001 |
| Finality | 12-15 minutes | Minutes to hours | ~0.5 seconds |
| Gas token | ETH | ETH | Stablecoins |
| Native stablecoin gas | No | No | Yes |
| Payment metadata | No | No | Yes |
| Stablecoin DEX | External | External | Native |
| EVM compatible | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Ethereum Strengths

### Largest Ecosystem

Ethereum has the most stablecoin liquidity, DeFi protocols, and developer tooling. USDC and USDT originated here, and major institutions trust Ethereum's security model.

### Battle-Tested Security

Running since 2015, Ethereum's consensus has withstood years of adversarial conditions. Its decentralization and validator set are unmatched.

### L2 Scaling Options

Rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base reduce fees significantly while inheriting Ethereum's security. Users can choose their preferred tradeoff between cost and decentralization.

### Composability

Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem allows payments to interact with lending, trading, and yield protocols in single transactions.

## Tempo Strengths

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Pay fees in USDC, USDT, or other stablecoins. No need to hold ETH or manage volatile token balances. Your portfolio stays 100% in stable value.

### Predictable Sub-Cent Fees

Tempo fees are approximately $0.001 regardless of network congestion. Ethereum L1 fees spike during demand; L2 fees, while lower, still vary.

### Instant Finality

Transactions finalize in ~0.5 seconds with no reorg risk. Ethereum L1 requires 12-15 minutes for finality. L2s inherit this delay for withdrawals and have varying confirmation times.

### Native Payment Features

Tempo includes built-in payment metadata for invoice references and reconciliation—features that require custom smart contracts on Ethereum.

## Use Cases: Where Each Excels

### Choose Ethereum When

- **DeFi integration matters**: You need lending, derivatives, or yield strategies
- **Maximum liquidity**: Large trades requiring deep order books
- **Established infrastructure**: Enterprise-grade custody, compliance tools
- **Smart contract complexity**: Advanced programmable logic beyond payments

### Choose Tempo When

- **Pure payment operations**: Send, receive, and hold stablecoins
- **High-volume, low-value transfers**: Micropayments, API billing, streaming payments
- **Treasury simplicity**: Avoid managing volatile gas tokens
- **Instant settlement required**: Point-of-sale, real-time payouts
- **Cost predictability**: Fixed sub-cent fees for budgeting

## Cost Comparison Example

Sending 100 USDC:

| Chain | Transaction Fee | Gas Token Required | Total Cost |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Ethereum L1 | $5-50 | ETH (~$10 buffer) | $15-60+ |
| Arbitrum | $0.10-0.50 | ETH (~$5 buffer) | $5-10 |
| Base | $0.01-0.10 | ETH (~$5 buffer) | $5-10 |
| Tempo | $0.001 | None (pay in USDC) | $0.001 |

*Note: L2 users must also hold ETH for gas, adding complexity and exposure to price volatility.*

## When to Choose Tempo

Tempo is the better choice if you:

- Want to avoid holding or managing ETH
- Need predictable, sub-cent transaction fees
- Require instant finality (not probabilistic)
- Process high volumes of stablecoin payments
- Value built-in payment metadata for reconciliation

Ethereum remains superior for DeFi composability, maximum decentralization, and access to the broadest ecosystem of protocols.
