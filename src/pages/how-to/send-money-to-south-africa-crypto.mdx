# Send Money to South Africa with Crypto

Send money to South Africa using stablecoins on Tempo. South Africa has one of the highest cryptocurrency adoption rates in the world, with approximately 10% of the population owning or using crypto and licensed Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) offering seamless ZAR conversions.

## The South Africa Corridor

South Africa is the largest remittance recipient in Southern Africa. Traditional costs: wire transfers $35-60, services 5-8%.

## Why South Africa Works

- Licensed CASPs with direct ZAR bank account withdrawals
- Major banks like Discovery Bank now integrate crypto trading
- Growing stablecoin adoption for cross-border payments
- Digital wallet ecosystem (PayShap) enabling instant settlements

## How It Works

1. Buy USDC through your preferred exchange
2. Send via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. Recipient converts to ZAR on a South African exchange
