# Send Money to Nepal with Crypto

Send money to Nepal using stablecoins on Tempo. With remittances at 33% of GDP, Nepali families deserve faster, cheaper transfers.

## The Nepal Corridor

Nepal receives over $14 billion in remittances annually, representing roughly one-third of the country's GDP — one of the highest ratios globally. Workers in the Gulf, Malaysia, and worldwide send money home to support families.

Traditional remittance costs:
- Wire transfers: $25-40 per transaction
- Remittance services: 4-7% in fees
- Delivery: 2-5 days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through any exchange or on-ramp service
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to NPR through local options

## Off-Ramp Options in Nepal

Your recipient can convert USDC to Nepali Rupees through:
- P2P marketplaces (most common)
- Regional exchanges serving South Asia
- Informal crypto communities
- Cross-border services via India
