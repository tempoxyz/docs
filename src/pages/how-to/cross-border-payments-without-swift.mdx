# Cross-Border Payments Without SWIFT

Bypass the SWIFT network entirely. Send payments globally in seconds using stablecoins on Tempo.

## Why Businesses Are Moving Beyond SWIFT

SWIFT transfers take 1-5 business days, cost $25-50 per transaction, and require multiple correspondent banks. For businesses making frequent international payments, these delays and costs add up quickly.

Tempo offers a modern alternative: stablecoin rails that settle instantly with predictable, near-zero fees.

## Tempo's Advantages for Cross-Border Payments

| Feature | SWIFT | Tempo |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Settlement time | 1-5 days | &lt;1 second |
| Cost per transfer | $25-50 | ~$0.001 |
| Operating hours | Banking hours | 24/7/365 |
| Transparency | Opaque routing | Full onchain visibility |
| Currency conversion | Bank FX rates | Direct stablecoin swaps |

## How It Works

Tempo provides dedicated payment lanes at the protocol level. Your payments don't compete with other blockchain traffic—fees stay low and predictable even during network congestion.

**Key features:**
- **Stablecoin-native gas**: Pay transaction fees in USD stablecoins, not volatile tokens
- **Payment metadata**: Attach invoice numbers, PO references, and cost centers directly to transactions
- **Deterministic finality**: Know exactly when your payment has settled, every time
