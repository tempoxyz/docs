# Send Money to Peru with Crypto

Send money to Peru using stablecoins on Tempo. Peruvians are increasingly adopting crypto as a hedge against inflation and political instability, with stablecoins accounting for 90% of fiat-to-crypto transactions on major platforms.

## The Peru Corridor

Peru receives substantial remittances from the US, Spain, and neighboring countries. Traditional costs: wire transfers $25-45, services 4-6%.

## Why Peru Works

- Stablecoins widely used for savings and inflation protection
- Digital wallets Yape (14M users) and Plin (14M users) now support crypto payments
- Growing exchange infrastructure with direct Sol (PEN) conversions
- Coinbase supports USDC-to-fiat in Peru

## How It Works

1. Buy USDC through your preferred exchange
2. Send via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. Recipient converts to Peruvian Sol on a local exchange
