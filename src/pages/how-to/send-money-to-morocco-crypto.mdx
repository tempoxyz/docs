# Send Money to Morocco with Crypto

Send money to Morocco using stablecoins on Tempo. As Europe's largest African remittance corridor, Moroccan families deserve better than 5-8% fees.

## The Morocco Corridor

Morocco receives over $12 billion in remittances annually, primarily from France, Spain, Italy, and the broader European diaspora. This makes it one of the largest African recipients of remittances.

Traditional remittance costs:
- Bank transfers: €15-35 per transaction
- Remittance services: 5-8% in fees
- Delivery: 1-3 days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through European exchanges or on-ramps
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to MAD through local options

## Off-Ramp Options in Morocco

Your recipient can convert USDC to Moroccan Dirhams through:
- P2P marketplaces
- Regional crypto platforms
- Informal exchange networks
- Cross-border services

## Cost Comparison

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Speed | 1-3 days | &lt;1 second |
| Fee | 5-8% | ~$0.001 |
| Availability | Banking hours | 24/7 |

## For the European Diaspora

- Send from any EU country at the same cost
- Weekend and holiday transfers
- No branch visits required
- Split payments to multiple family members easily
