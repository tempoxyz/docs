# Send Money to France with Crypto

Send money to France instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Skip SWIFT fees and FX spreads to Europe's second-largest economy.

## The France Corridor

France is a major hub for international transfers, with significant flows from North America, Africa, and across Europe. Traditional banking still dominates, but comes with familiar costs.

Traditional transfer costs:
- SWIFT transfers: $25-50 plus FX spread
- Bank transfers: 1-3% FX markup
- Settlement time: 1-3 business days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to EUR through local exchanges or services

## Off-Ramp Options in France

Your recipient can convert USDC to Euros through:
- French and European crypto exchanges
- PSAN-registered platforms (French crypto license)
- P2P marketplaces
- Crypto-enabled banking apps

## Why Stablecoins Beat Traditional Transfers
