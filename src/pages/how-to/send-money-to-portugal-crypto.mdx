# Send Money to Portugal with Crypto

Send money to Portugal instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Portugal's crypto-friendly environment makes this corridor particularly smooth.

## The Portugal Corridor

Portugal has emerged as one of Europe's most crypto-friendly nations, with clear regulations and growing adoption. The country receives significant remittances from the US, France, and other EU nations.

Traditional transfer costs:
- SWIFT transfers: $25-40 plus FX spread
- Remittance services: 2-4% fees
- Settlement time: 1-2 business days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to EUR through local exchanges or services

## Off-Ramp Options in Portugal

Portugal's crypto-friendly stance means easy conversion:
- Portuguese and European exchanges
- Crypto-enabled neobanks
- P2P marketplaces
- Growing merchant acceptance

## Why Stablecoins Beat Traditional Transfers
