# Send Money to Myanmar with Crypto

Send money to Myanmar using stablecoins on Tempo. In a challenging environment, crypto offers a resilient alternative.

## Myanmar Remittance Corridor

Myanmar has historically received significant remittances from workers in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Middle East. However, traditional channels face severe challenges:

- Wire transfers: Often unavailable or restricted
- Remittance services: Limited operations
- Banking system: Significant disruptions
- Delivery times: Unpredictable

## Current Situation

**Important:** Myanmar's political situation since 2021 has created significant challenges for financial services. Traditional banking infrastructure is disrupted, many international services have suspended operations, and the local currency (Kyat) has experienced volatility. Please research current conditions and applicable restrictions before sending funds.

## Why Crypto May Help

In disrupted environments, stablecoins can offer:
- Transfers independent of banking infrastructure
- Value stability in USD terms
- 24/7 availability without institutional dependencies
- Direct peer-to-peer transfers

## How to Send

1. **Buy USDC** on any exchange or on-ramp
2. **Send to Myanmar recipient** via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Instant arrival** — recipient sees funds in seconds
4. **Recipient converts locally** via available channels

## Off-Ramp Considerations

Off-ramp options in Myanmar are limited and informal:
- P2P trading networks
- Informal exchange services
- Cross-border solutions via Thailand
- Direct crypto-to-goods transactions

## Cost Comparison

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Speed | Unpredictable | &lt;1 second |
| Cost | High/variable | ~$0.001 |
| Availability | Limited | 24/7 |
| Currency stability | Kyat volatility | USD-pegged |

## Important Considerations

- Verify current sanctions and restrictions before sending
- Understand the recipient's ability to access and convert funds
- Be aware that off-ramp options may be limited and informal
- Stay informed about the evolving situation
