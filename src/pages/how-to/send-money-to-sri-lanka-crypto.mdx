# Send Money to Sri Lanka with Crypto

Send money to Sri Lanka using stablecoins on Tempo. Fast, low-cost transfers to support families during challenging economic times.

## The Sri Lanka Corridor

Sri Lanka receives over $6 billion in remittances annually from workers in the Gulf, Europe, and worldwide. Given recent economic challenges, these transfers are more vital than ever for Sri Lankan families.

Traditional remittance costs:
- Wire transfers: $25-40 per transaction
- Remittance services: 4-7% in fees
- Delivery: 2-5 days

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through any exchange or on-ramp service
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to LKR through local options

## Off-Ramp Options in Sri Lanka

Your recipient can convert USDC to Sri Lankan Rupees through:
- P2P marketplaces (growing rapidly)
- Regional exchanges serving South Asia
- Local crypto communities
- Informal exchange networks

## Cost Comparison

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |

## Stability During Uncertainty
