# Consensus and Finality

Tempo uses Simplex BFT consensus to provide deterministic, sub-second finality. This page describes the consensus mechanism, finality guarantees, and fault tolerance properties.

## Simplex BFT Consensus

Tempo uses Simplex Consensus, implemented by [Commonware](https://www.commonware.xyz/). Simplex is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol optimized for fast finality with graceful degradation under adverse network conditions.

### Block Production

Blocks are produced approximately every 0.5 seconds under normal network conditions. Proposer selection follows a round-robin pattern among active validators. Once a block is finalized, it cannot be reverted.

### Deterministic Finality

Tempo provides deterministic finality rather than probabilistic finality. When a block is marked as finalized, transactions in that block are guaranteed to remain in the canonical chain. There is no reorg risk after finality.

For payment applications, this provides the settlement certainty that operators expect from traditional financial systems.

## Validator Set

### Current Configuration

The testnet operates with 4 validators in a permissioned configuration. Mainnet will launch with institutional validators, also permissioned initially. The roadmap includes a path to permissionless validation.

### Fault Tolerance

Simplex BFT tolerates Byzantine validators up to a threshold:

- The network maintains safety as long as fewer than one-third of validators are Byzantine
- The network maintains liveness as long as at least two-thirds of validators are honest and online

With 4 validators, the network tolerates 1 Byzantine validator. With 10 validators, the network tolerates 3 Byzantine validators.

## Distributed Validation

Tempo uses a distributed validator set rather than a single sequencer. Multiple validators share block production responsibility. Transactions can be included by any proposer, preventing single points of censorship. The network can continue finalizing blocks as long as two-thirds of validators are online and honest.

## Degraded State Behavior

Under adverse conditions, Simplex consensus degrades gracefully:

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Network partition | Block times may increase but finality guarantees are preserved |
| Validator offline within threshold | Network continues with remaining validators |
| More than one-third of validators offline | Network halts and resumes when threshold is restored |

The protocol prioritizes safety over liveness. It will halt rather than produce conflicting blocks.

## For Integrators

Treat finalized blocks as irreversible for settlement purposes. No additional confirmations are needed after finality. Query finalized blocks using `eth_getBlockByNumber` with the `finalized` tag.
