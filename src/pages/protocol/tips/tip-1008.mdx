# TIP-1008: Account Ownership Transfer

## Abstract

TIP-1008 introduces the ability for Tempo accounts to transfer ownership to a new address or permanently disable root key control by transferring to `address(0)`. This enables multisig governance (where the root key should not have unilateral control) and prepares for post-quantum cryptography migration (where accounts can add a PQ-secure key and disable the classical root key).

To ensure security, this TIP also modifies signature verification at the protocol level: `ecrecover` and other signature verification precompiles will check if an account has transferred ownership, preventing the original root key from signing valid messages (including EIP-2612 permits, Permit2, and any EIP-712 signed messages).

## Motivation

### Multisig Governance

Currently, multisig wallets on Tempo still have a root key that could theoretically bypass the multisig. For true multisig security, the root key must be completely disabled, forcing all operations through the multisig logic.

### Post-Quantum Cryptography

As quantum computing advances, accounts will need to migrate from ECDSA (secp256k1/P256) to post-quantum signature schemes. This requires:
1. Adding a PQ-secure access key
2. Disabling the classical root key to prevent quantum attacks

### Signature Verification Attack Surface

Without protocol-level enforcement, a "disabled" root key could still sign valid messages for:
- EIP-2612 `permit()` on TIP-20 tokens
- Permit2 signatures
- Any contract using `ecrecover` directly
- EIP-712 typed data signatures

This TIP ensures that ownership transfer/relinquishment is enforced at the signature verification level, not just the account level.

# Specification

## Storage Changes

### AccountKeychain Precompile

Add a new storage mapping to track account ownership:

```solidity
// owner[account] -> owner address
// - address(0) means the root key (derived from account address) is the owner (default)
// - any other address means ownership has been transferred to that address
// - account address means ownership is relinquished (root key disabled, no new owner)
mapping(address account => address owner) public accountOwner;
```

**Ownership States:**

| `accountOwner[account]` | Meaning |
|------------------------|---------|
| `address(0)` | Default: root key (= account address) is owner |
| `account` (self) | Relinquished: root key disabled, no external owner |
| Other address | Transferred: new address is the owner |

## New Precompile Functions

### `transferOwnership`

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer account ownership to a new address or relinquish control
/// @param newOwner The new owner address. Use address(0) to relinquish control.
/// @dev Can only be called by the current owner (root key or transferred owner).
///      - If newOwner is address(0), sets accountOwner[account] = account (relinquished)
///      - Otherwise, sets accountOwner[account] = newOwner
///      Once relinquished (set to self), ownership CANNOT be reclaimed.
///      Emits OwnershipTransferred event.
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external;
```

### `getOwner`

```solidity
/// @notice Get the current owner of an account
/// @param account The account to query
/// @return owner The owner address:
///         - address(0) if root key is owner (default)
///         - account address if relinquished
///         - other address if transferred
function getOwner(address account) external view returns (address owner);
```

### `isRootKeyActive`

```solidity
/// @notice Check if the root key is still active for an account
/// @param account The account to query
/// @return active True if root key can sign for this account, false if ownership transferred/relinquished
/// @dev Returns true only if accountOwner[account] == address(0)
function isRootKeyActive(address account) external view returns (bool active);
```

## New Events

```solidity
/// @notice Emitted when account ownership is transferred or relinquished
/// @param account The account whose ownership changed
/// @param previousOwner The previous owner (address(0) for root key)
/// @param newOwner The new owner (account address if relinquished, address(0) means root key)
event OwnershipTransferred(
    address indexed account,
    address indexed previousOwner,
    address indexed newOwner
);
```

## New Errors

```solidity
/// @notice Caller is not the current owner of the account
error NotOwner();

/// @notice Cannot transfer ownership - account ownership has been relinquished
error OwnershipRelinquished();

/// @notice Cannot transfer ownership to the account's own address directly
/// @dev Use address(0) to relinquish ownership instead
error InvalidNewOwner();
```

## Ownership Transfer Behavior

### Authorization

Only the current owner can call `transferOwnership`:

1. **Default state** (`accountOwner[account] == address(0)`): The root key (transaction signed by account's private key) can transfer
2. **Transferred state** (`accountOwner[account] == someAddress`): Only `someAddress` can call (as msg.sender or via their root key)
3. **Relinquished state** (`accountOwner[account] == account`): NO ONE can transfer - ownership is permanently disabled

### Transfer Logic

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external {
    address account = msg.sender;
    address currentOwner = accountOwner[account];

    // Check authorization
    // If currentOwner is address(0), root key is owner - checked via transactionKey
    // If currentOwner is account itself, ownership is relinquished
    if (currentOwner == account) {
        revert OwnershipRelinquished();
    }

    // For non-default ownership, the caller must be the current owner
    if (currentOwner != address(0)) {
        if (msg.sender != currentOwner) {
            revert NotOwner();
        }
    } else {
        // Default state: root key must authorize
        if (transactionKey != address(0)) {
            revert NotOwner();
        }
    }

    // Cannot set newOwner to account address directly - use address(0) for relinquish
    if (newOwner == account) {
        revert InvalidNewOwner();
    }

    address effectiveNewOwner = newOwner;
    if (newOwner == address(0)) {
        // Relinquish: store account address to mark as permanently disabled
        effectiveNewOwner = account;
    }

    emit OwnershipTransferred(account, currentOwner, effectiveNewOwner);
    accountOwner[account] = effectiveNewOwner;
}
```

## Signature Verification Modifications

### ecrecover Interception

The protocol MUST intercept `ecrecover` (precompile at `0x01`) to check ownership status:

```
ecrecover_modified(hash, v, r, s):
    1. recovered_address = ecrecover_original(hash, v, r, s)
    2. if recovered_address == address(0):
        return address(0)  // Invalid signature
    3. owner_status = AccountKeychain.accountOwner[recovered_address]
    4. if owner_status != address(0):
        // Ownership transferred or relinquished - root key invalid
        return address(0)
    5. return recovered_address
```

### P256 and WebAuthn Verification

The same ownership check MUST be applied to P256 (`0x100`) and WebAuthn signature verification precompiles.

## Gas Costs

| Operation | Gas Cost |
|-----------|----------|
| `transferOwnership` | 25,000 (storage write) |
| `getOwner` | 2,600 (cold) / 100 (warm) |
| `isRootKeyActive` | 2,600 (cold) / 100 (warm) |
| `ecrecover` ownership check | +2,600 (cold) / +100 (warm) per call |

│ owner = newAddr │ ───────────────────────────────────────┘
└─────────────────┘   transferOwnership(0x0)
```

## Core Invariants

1. **Ownership monotonicity**: Once ownership is relinquished, it can NEVER be reclaimed
2. **Root key invalidation**: After ownership transfer, `ecrecover` returning the account address MUST fail ownership checks
3. **Access key preservation**: Existing access keys remain valid after ownership transfer
4. **Signature verification consistency**: All signature verification paths MUST enforce ownership checks
