# Tempo Protocol

Tempo is a blockchain protocol purpose-built for global payments. Rather than being a general-purpose platform, Tempo makes deliberate technical choices optimized for payments at scale.

This section provides details on the Tempo Protocol specifications, and serves as a technical reference for protocol implementers, auditors, and core contributors building on Tempo.
