# EIP-7702 and Tempo Transactions

EIP-7702 allows EOAs to delegate to smart contract code temporarily within a transaction. Tempo Transactions build on this foundation and extend it with additional capabilities.

## EIP-7702 Design Goals

EIP-7702 enables EOAs to:

- **Delegate to contract code**: An EOA can execute as if it were a smart contract
- **Batch transactions**: Through delegation to a batching contract
- **Maintain EOA properties**: The account remains an EOA after the transaction

## How Tempo Extends EIP-7702

Tempo Transactions support EIP-7702 style delegation through the `aa_authorization_list` field. This field follows EIP-7702 semantics for delegation and execution.

### Extended Signature Support

EIP-7702 on Ethereum only supports secp256k1 signatures for the authorization.

Tempo extends this to support all Tempo signature types. Authorizations can be signed with secp256k1, P256, or WebAuthn. This enables delegation from passkey-based accounts.

### Native Features Beyond Delegation

EIP-7702 provides delegation as a building block. Applications must implement higher-level features through the delegated contract.

Tempo Transactions include these features natively:

- **Fee sponsorship**: Built into the transaction type, not requiring delegation. See the [fee sponsorship guide](/guide/payments/sponsor-user-fees).
- **Scheduled execution**: Native `validAfter` and `validBefore` timestamp windows for time-bounded transactions.
- **Parallelizable nonces**: Multiple nonce keys for concurrent transactions. See the [parallel transactions guide](/guide/payments/send-parallel-transactions).
- **Access keys**: Delegate signing to secondary keys with configurable permissions. See the [Account Keychain specification](/protocol/transactions/AccountKeychain).

### Combining Delegation with Native Features

Tempo Transactions can use EIP-7702 delegation alongside native features. An application can delegate an EOA to contract code while also using fee sponsorship and batched calls from the protocol.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | EIP-7702 | Tempo Transactions |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| EOA delegation | Yes | Yes |
| Signature schemes | secp256k1 only | secp256k1, P256, WebAuthn |
| Fee sponsorship | Via delegated contract | Native |
| Batching | Via delegated contract | Native |
| Scheduled execution | Not available | Native |
| Concurrent nonces | Not available | Native |

## Implementation

The `aa_authorization_list` field in Tempo Transactions contains authorizations that follow EIP-7702 structure. Each authorization delegates an account to a specified implementation contract and is signed by the account authority.

For full details on the authorization format, see the [Tempo Transaction Specification](/protocol/transactions/spec-tempo-transaction).

## Getting Started

To start using Tempo Transactions, see the [Tempo Transactions guide](/guide/tempo-transaction) for SDK integration in TypeScript, Rust, Go, and Python.
