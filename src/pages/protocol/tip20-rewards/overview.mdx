# TIP-20 Rewards

TIP-20 Rewards is a built-in mechanism that allows for efficient distribution of rewards to opted-in token holders proportional to their holdings, while maintaining low gas costs at scale and complying with [TIP-403 transfer policies](/protocol/tip403/spec).

Traditional reward mechanisms require tokens to be staked in separate contracts, which fragments user holdings and adds complexity to wallet implementations. TIP-20 Rewards solves this by:

- **Built-in Distribution**: Rewards are integrated directly into the token contract, no separate staking required
- **Opt-in Participation**: Users choose whether to participate by setting a reward recipient
- **Proportional Distribution**: Rewards accrue based on token holdings automatically
- **Instant Rewards**: Distribute rewards immediately to opted-in holders
- **Efficient at Scale**: Constant-time updates regardless of the number of token holders
- **Policy Compliant**: All reward transfers respect TIP-403 transfer policies
