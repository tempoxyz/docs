# Quote Tokens

## Overview

On Tempo's [decentralized exchange](/protocol/exchange/spec.mdx), each TIP-20 token selects another TIP-20 as its **quote token**—the token it trades against. This creates a tree structure that guarantees exactly one path between any two tokens, reducing liquidity fragmentation and simplifying routing.

## How Quote Tokens Work

When creating a TIP-20, you specify a quote token:

```solidity
TIP20 token = factory.createToken(
  "My Company USD",
  "MCUSD",
  "USD",
  quoteToken, // The token this will trade against
  msg.sender,
  bytes32("my-unique-salt")
);
```

This means your token trades directly against the quote token on the DEX. Users can swap between tokens that share a common quote token, or that are connected through a multi-hop path.

## Choosing a Quote Token

You can choose **any** existing TIP-20 as your quote token. Common options include:

- **[pathUSD](/protocol/exchange/quote-tokens/pathUSD)** — A USD-denominated stablecoin designed specifically for use as a quote token
- **Another stablecoin** — Any other USD stablecoin on Tempo
- **A different token** — Any TIP-20 that makes sense for your use case

The choice is entirely up to the token issuer. Using pathUSD is optional.

## Tree Structure

The quote token system creates a tree structure where all tokens sharing a currency denomination are connected:

```
               USDX
                |
             pathUSD -- USDY -- USDZ
                |
               USDA
```

This structure:
- **Guarantees single-path routing** between any two tokens
- **Concentrates liquidity** instead of fragmenting it across multiple pairs
- **Simplifies price discovery** even for thinly-traded pairs
