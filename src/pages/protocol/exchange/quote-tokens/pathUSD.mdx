# pathUSD

pathUSD is one of many possible [quote tokens](/protocol/exchange/quote-tokens) on Tempo. It is a USD-denominated stablecoin that token issuers can optionally select when creating their TIP-20.

:::info
**pathUSD is optional.** Token issuers can choose any TIP-20 as their quote token—pathUSD is simply one available option.
:::

## Overview

Each USD TIP-20 on Tempo can choose any other USD TIP-20 as its [quote token](/protocol/exchange/quote-tokens)—the token it is paired against on the [native decentralized exchange](/protocol/exchange/spec.mdx). This guarantees that there is one path between any two tokens, which reduces fragmentation of liquidity and simplifies routing.

Tempo offers pathUSD as one option that stablecoins can choose as their quote token if they wish. pathUSD is not meant to compete as a consumer-facing stablecoin—it exists purely as a routing mechanism for those who choose to use it.

pathUSD can also be accepted as a fee token by validators, and is used as the fallback gas token when no other is specified.

## Specification

### Contract

pathUSD is a predeployed [TIP-20](/protocol/tip20/spec.mdx) at genesis. Note that since it is the first TIP-20 contract deployed, its quote token is the zero address.

| Property      | Value                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| address       | `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000`                          |
| `name()`        | "pathUSD"                                                             |
| `symbol()`      | "pathUSD"                                                             |
| `currency()`    | "USD"                                                                 |
| `decimals()`    | 6                                                                     |
| `quoteToken()`  | `address(0)`                                        |

## How It Works

When you create a USD stablecoin on Tempo, you can set pathUSD as its quote token:

```solidity
TIP20 token = factory.createToken(
  "My Company USD",
  "MCUSD",
  "USD",
  TIP20(0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000), // pathUSD
  msg.sender,
  bytes32("my-unique-salt") // salt for deterministic address
);
```

This means:
- Your token trades against pathUSD on the decentralized exchange
- Users can swap between your token and other USD stablecoins that also use pathUSD, or ones that are connected to it by a multi-hop path

### Tree Structure

This creates a tree structure where all USD stablecoins are connected via multi-hop paths.

```
               USDX
                |
             pathUSD -- USDY -- USDZ
                |
               USDA
```

The tree structure guarantees that there is a single path between any two USD stablecoins, ensuring simple routing, concentrated liquidity, and efficient pricing, even for thinly-traded pairs.

### Example: Cross-Stablecoin Payment

1. Market makers provide liquidity for USDX/pathUSD and USDY/pathUSD pairs
2. User wants to send USDX to a merchant who prefers USDY
3. DEX atomically routes: User's USDX → pathUSD → Merchant's USDY
4. Single action, no manual swaps

This is critical for payments between parties with different stablecoin preferences. The user and merchant never touch pathUSD; it is used only as a routing mechanism.
