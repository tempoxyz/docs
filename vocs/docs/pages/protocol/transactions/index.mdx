# Transactions

## Fees

Tempo's fee system allows users to pay transaction fees in any supported USD stablecoin, with a target fee of approximately $0.001 USD per transfer. The system features multi-stablecoin support, automatic token conversion when needed, and a fixed base fee rate (20 × 10⁻⁹ USD per gas), all while maintaining network security and preventing spam.

Roughly, it works like this:

1. The user specifies a preferred fee token, or uses the default option.
2. The validator specifies the preferred fee token they wish to receive.
3. If the user's token and the validator's token match, the fee is paid directly to the validator.
4. If the tokens differ, the system automatically converts the fee through the Fee AMM.
5. In all cases, the fees ultimately go to the validator, maintaining network security.
