# Tempo Protocol Specifications [The blockchain built for payments]

Fundamentally, Tempo extends the Ethereum protocol. Thus, it is fully EVM compatible.

Tempo is being implemented using [`reth`](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), with several optimizations and improvements made to support payments use cases. To achieve the goals laid out in the [Tempo litepaper](/litepaper), several native token, transaction, and account features are introduced. 

Protocol specifications are organized into the following sections:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Tokens](/protocol/tokens) | Native token standards and protocols (TIP-20, TIP-403, TIP-4217). |
| [Transactions](/protocol/transactions) | Transaction processing, fees, token preferences, and payments lane. |
| [Accounts](/protocol/accounts) | Account model (EIP-7702). |
| [Payments Lane](/protocol/payments-lane) | Reserved blockspace for payments. |
