# Transaction Fees

Tempo lets you pay transaction fees in stablecoins instead of a native network token. When you send a transaction, you can choose which supported token to use for fees.

By default, Tempo will use your preferred fee token if you’ve set one, or you can pick a different token for each transaction. The fee is automatically deducted from your balance in that token, and you don’t have to worry about conversions or extra steps.

This makes it easy to use Tempo for payments and everyday transactions, since you can pay fees directly in the same stablecoins you already use.


## Set a Default Fee Token

You can set a default fee token preference for your account to avoid specifying it in every transaction.

### Using the FeeManager Precompile

```javascript
// Set USDC as your default fee token
import { getContract } from 'viem'

const feeManager = getContract({
  // FeeManager precompile
  address: '0xfeec000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  abi: feeManagerAbi,
  client: wallet, // viem wallet client instance
})

await feeManager.setUserToken(testUSDTokenAddress);
```

### What This Does

- **All future transactions** will use USDC for fees by default
- **Transaction-level preferences** still override this setting
- **No fee token specified** in a transaction will use your default
- **One-time setup** - you don't need to specify the fee token in every transaction

### Changing Your Default

```javascript
// Change default
await feeManager.setUserToken(newUSDTokenAddress);

// Remove default (will use validator's preference)
await feeManager.setUserToken(viem.ZeroAddress);
```

## Fee Token Requirements

- Must be a **USD stablecoin**
- Must have **sufficient balance** to cover the transaction's gas limit
- Must have **liquidity** in the Fee AMM for conversion if needed
- **Transaction-level** preferences override account-level preferences
