# Fee Sponsorship

Fee sponsorship allows one account (the **fee payer**) to pay transaction fees on behalf of another account (the **sender**). This enables gasless transactions where users can interact with the blockchain without holding any tokens to pay for gas.

<Callout type="info">
  Fee sponsorship works with Tempo's native fee token transaction type. The fee payer covers the transaction fees while the sender executes the transaction logic.

## Use Cases

- **Onboarding new users** — Let users interact without first acquiring tokens
- **Subsidizing transactions** — Applications can cover gas costs for their users
- **Payment flows** — Enable payments from accounts without requiring separate fee tokens

## Local Fee Payer

The simplest approach is to specify a `feePayer` account directly when sending a transaction. This is useful when you have access to both the sender's and fee payer's private keys locally.

:::code-group
```ts [customFeePayer.ts]
import { mnemonicToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'

// Funded account that will pay the fees
const feePayer = mnemonicToAccount(
  'test test test test test test test test test test test junk'
)

const hash = await client.sendTransaction({ // [!code focus]
  feePayer, // [!code focus]
  to: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // [!code focus]
}) // [!code focus]
```

```ts [viem.config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/setup.ts:setup] 
```

### How It Works

1. The sender signs the transaction with their private key
2. The fee payer signs the same transaction to authorize paying the fees
3. Both signatures are submitted together in a single transaction
4. The network validates both signatures and executes the transaction
5. Fees are deducted from the fee payer's balance
