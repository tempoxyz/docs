## How do I deploy a contract on Tempo?

The easiest way to deploy contract(s) on Tempo is by using [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/), a blazing-fast toolkit for EVM networks.

Below is a basic guide on how to deploy your first contract, but for more detailed instructions, see the [Deploying Guide](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/deploying) on the [Foundry docs](https://getfoundry.sh).

::::steps

### 1. Install Foundry

```bash [Terminal]
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 2a. Initialize a new Project

If you have not initialized a project yet, you can use the `forge init` command.

If you already have a project, continue to [2b. Add Foundry to an existing Project](#2b-add-foundry-to-an-existing-project).

```bash [Terminal]
forge init example && cd example
```

### 2b. Add Foundry to an existing Project

If you already have an existing contracts project, add a `foundry.toml` file to the root directory.

```toml [foundry.toml]
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
remappings = ["forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/"]

# See more config options https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/config/README.md#all-options
```

:::info
Ensure that your source files are hooked up correctly in the `foundry.toml` file.

### 3. Deploy

Next, we can deploy our contract using the `forge create` or `forge script` command.

```bash [Terminal]
export PRIVATE_KEY="0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80"

# Deploy a contract using the `forge create` command.
forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter \
  --rpc-url https://{username}:{password}@rpc-adagio.tempoxyz.dev \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Or deploy contract(s) using a .s.sol script.
forge script src/Counter.s.sol:Counter \
  --rpc-url https://{username}:{password}@rpc-adagio.tempoxyz.dev \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast
```
