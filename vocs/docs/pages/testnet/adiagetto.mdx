# Adiagetto [The second Tempo testnet]

📅 The second testnet, Adiagetto, is slated to be released at the end of September.

**Default Account Abstraction**. Adiagetto is the first tesnet with native account abstraction built in. It introduces [Default Account Abstraction (DAA)](/protocol/accounts), a method for all addresses to become "activated" as EIP-7702 contract wallets upon first use.

**Fee AMM**. Adiagetto also introduces the [Fee AMM](/protocol/fees/fee-amm), a protocol-level automated market maker that enables users to pay gas fees in any supported stablecoin.

Additionally, we anticipate adding payment lanes functionality and the first approach to consensus in Adiagetto. These features are not yet documented.
