# Adagietto [The second Tempo testnet]

📅 The second testnet, Adagietto, is now live and introduces several key features for multi-stablecoin payments.

## What's New

### 1. Pay Fees in Any Stablecoin

Adagietto introduces the ability to pay transaction fees using any supported stablecoin. No more need to hold a specific gas token. You can pay fees directly with one of the three testnet tokens: AlphaUSD, BetaUSD, or ThetaUSD.

**How to use it:** Send a transaction and the protocol automatically handles the fee conversion. Learn how to [specify your preferred fee token](/documentation/transactions/fees#custom-fee-tokens) in transactions.

**How it works:** This is enabled by the [Fee AMM](/protocol/transactions/fee-amm), which provides liquidity for converting between different stablecoins. The system automatically handles the conversion from your preferred token to the validator's preferred token at a fixed 99.70% rate.

**Becoming a Liquidity Provider:** You can [add and remove liquidity](/documentation/transactions/fee-amm#adding-liquidity-to-the-fee-amm) from the Fee AMM pools to earn fees from the conversion process. Use the [built-in faucet](#faucet) to get any of the supported test tokens to start providing liquidity.

### 2. Default Account Abstraction

All addresses can now be "activated" as smart contract wallets upon first use, enabling advanced features like gasless transactions and custom validation logic. See the [Default Account Abstraction documentation](/protocol/accounts) for implementation details.

```

## Explorer & Tools

For now we have stood up a very basic Blockscout instance to explore the testnet.

| Explorer Parameter         | Value                                           |

Speak to the Tempo team for an explorer username and password.

If there are any tools you rely on we can preconfigure for future testnets, let us know.
