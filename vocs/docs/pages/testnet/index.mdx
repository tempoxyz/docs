# Overview

Thank you for your support as we build Tempo!

We're building Tempo in close collaboration with great design partners that have prodction use cases using stablecoins today. Our development philosophy is to iterate rapidly with frequent feedback from our design partners.

We're rolling out a series of testnets, each introducing new features as we continue to develop Tempo. For detailed documentation, see the [docs](/documentation). For an in-depth understanding of the protocol, see the [protocol specifications](/protocol).
