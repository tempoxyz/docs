# Use Cases

Tempo design partners have focused on an initial set of use cases with high demand. The goal is to ensure Tempo works as a settlement layer for any payment flow, with any stablecoin, between multiple counterparties and security models.

## Remittances

Global, 24/7 transfers have become a major use case for stablecoins, as users in the global south value access to hold, spend, and send a stable currency. Tempo enables cross-border settlement to any wallet, in any stablecoin. At launch, Tempo is designed to support all fiat stablecoins and tokenized deposits.

Tempo's ultra-low, predictable fees and ability to support gas in any stablecoin make remittances much more performant for any developer interfacing with stablecoins. There's no competition from network traffic (such as airdrops or memecoin launches): payments get dedicated blockspace.

## Instant Settlement

Transactions on Tempo have a finality of approximately one second. This speed means consumers, businesses, and payments companies can spend or manage cash immediately. It lowers risk in the system and reduces the overall cost and complexity of managing cross-border and domestic transactions.

Tempo's high throughput (targeting 100,000 TPS) and dedicated blockspace add predictability to this speed. This predictability and robustness will be critical for at-scale payments transactions to come onto the network.

## Embedded Finance and Card Issuing

Embedded payments, lending, and cards have become major revenue streams for marketplaces and platforms. Stablecoins are operating as a platform to build new financial products such as stablecoin-linked cards. For developers, these cards are often available in markets they couldn't previously access, and, in the case of credit, can be lower-risk through instant settlement from card networks.

At-scale platforms and marketplaces require robust performance from their embedded finance offerings, and backward compatibility with their existing systems of record and bank partners. Tempo is designed to offer reconciliation (through memos) and compliance hooks to ensure payments products can balance the tension of being lower cost and faster, with being highly compliant and scalable.

## Global Payouts

Businesses often need to pay customers or employees with one-off transactions on an infrequent basis (e.g., a paycheck). In this scenario, they'll often have a low volume of such payments. Traditional payment networks can be an expensive and slow option, whereas stablecoins can be instant and low cost. This is especially popular in markets with hyperinflation or where the local currency is not widely traded.

Tempo natively supports batched and scheduled transactions, enabling a payroll run every two weeks or monthly to operate on a “set and forget” basis directly in the network.

## Agentic Commerce

Autonomous agents and AI models will increasingly interact and transact with each other, requiring instant, verifiable settlement and programmatic payment logic. Tempo provides this through programmatic payments that settle instantly onchain. These come with cryptographic proof of settlement, allowing mutually unknown agents to ensure audit and reconciliation can be completed.

Tempo achieves this through memo fields, allowing agents to embed rich structured data (like invoice IDs, service metadata, or conditional payment instructions). A single agent can also sponsor gas fees for other agents to simplify orchestration or batch transactions to pay multiple specialized AIs.

## Tokenized Deposits

Financial institutions can adopt instant, global, and 24/7 money movement by tokenizing their existing deposits. This enables their customers to transact during weekends, and with tokenized deposits, the settlement is instantaneous. This may reduce risk (and cost) in many industries like payments and be highly desirable for many Fortune 500s managing their supply chain or market risk.

Tempo is being designed to support the highly complex combination of compliance and privacy requirements financial institutions require to operate with confidence and scale.
