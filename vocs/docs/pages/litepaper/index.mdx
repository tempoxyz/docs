# Litepaper [The blockchain for payments]

## Abstract 

Tempo is a layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for payments, developed in partnership with category-leading companies to bring global payments volume onchain. Optimized engineering and dedicated blockspace for payments ensure low-cost transfers even when demand is high. A built-in system for stablecoin liquidity allows easy cross-stablecoin payments, as well as paying transaction fees in any stablecoin. Tempo is designed to be a neutral platform with a distributed validator set and permissionless issuance of any stablecoin.

### Contents

The Tempo Litepaper is organized into the following sections, each addressing a core aspect of the protocol:

- **[Motivation](/litepaper/motivation):** Why payments need their own chain, and the principles guiding Tempo's design.
- **[Neutrality](/litepaper/neutrality):** How Tempo avoids privileging any single stablecoin or issuer, enabling a level playing field for all participants.
- **[Payments](/litepaper/payments):** The payment flows, features, and optimizations that make Tempo uniquely suited for real-world payment use cases.
- **[Privacy](/litepaper/privacy):** The protocol's approach to privacy, balancing user confidentiality with compliance and auditability.
- **[Performance](/litepaper/performance):** The technical innovations and architecture that deliver high throughput, low latency, and predictable fees.
- **[Use Cases](/litepaper/use-cases):** Practical applications and scenarios where Tempo delivers value, from remittances to embedded finance and tokenized deposits.

Each section provides a focused explanation of the rationale, design, and benefits of Tempo’s approach to building the blockchain for payments.
