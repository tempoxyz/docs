# Performance

A payments network is only as useful as its worst day. The chain can already handle capacity in the tens of thousands of transfers per second, with a clear line of sight to orders of magnitude higher. 

Further, the design prioritizes predictability over peak headline numbers. A key mechanism here is a dedicated transfer lane: a sequencing path reserved for token transfers that is not starved by unrelated compute. This means that a burst of complex application activity, such as a popular NFT drop or a burst in trading activity, does not delay payroll runs, settlement batches, or time‑critical disbursements.

## Execution Client

The underlying execution client of the network is based on Reth, a high-performance EVM client. We implement many of these features as client precompiles, giving them native execution and better performance than equivalent Solidity code running in the virtual machine. 

In testing, Tempo has already measured tens of thousands of transfers per second in early devnets, with a clear line of sight to 100,000 tps and more. 

## Consensus

Tempo will start with a permissioned validator set to meet the reliability, monitoring, and incident-response expectations of early partners. Under the hood, we use Commonware's Simplex consensus algorithm, a variant of Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus (BFT) that is robust and performant. Tempo has one-second block times with single slot finality. In practice, that means a payment transaction is final as soon as it is included on the chain. We plan to grow the validator set over time, and expand to permissionless validation as the chain matures.
