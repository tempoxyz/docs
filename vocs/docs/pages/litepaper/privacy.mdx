# Privacy

Payments often require privacy—whether for business transactions, consumer balances, or sensitive payment flows—while still needing auditability for regulators and risk teams. Tempo’s privacy approach aims to satisfy both needs without splintering the ecosystem:

* **Private transfers and balances:** Sensitive business logic and balance details can live on a privacy‑preserving layer when required by users, policy, or regulation.
* **Compliance support:** The activity for any particular issuer is transparent to that issuer, so they can satisfy compliance and reporting obligations. Users can choose issuers whose privacy policy aligns with their preferences.
* **Avoiding fragmentation:** Private activity should not fork liquidity, standards, or tooling away from the public layer.
* **Compatibility and scale:** Privacy features should maintain compatibility with existing Tempo standards and scale to support high-volume payment flows.

## Privacy Roadmap

Tempo is committed to supporting privacy as a first-class feature for payments, while ensuring that compliance and ecosystem unity are preserved. The protocol is being designed to enable privacy-preserving transfers and balances, with mechanisms for issuers to meet their regulatory obligations and for users to select the privacy policies that best fit their needs.

Our approach is to avoid fragmenting liquidity or standards, so that private and public activity can coexist without creating silos. Privacy features will be developed with a focus on compatibility, scalability, and the needs of both users and issuers.

Further details on privacy architecture and implementation will be shared as the protocol evolves.
